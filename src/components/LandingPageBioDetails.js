  Joel's been working as a lead frontend engineer for some length of time. He is also learning about managing people and building up the team from scratch too. In his free time, he listens to jazz, plays guitar or piano, or learns new things. Right now he's based in Seoul (instead of Hong Kong), but things can always move him. He's most experienced with React.
