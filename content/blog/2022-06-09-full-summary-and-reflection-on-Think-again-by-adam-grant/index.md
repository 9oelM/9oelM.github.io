This is my own full summary and reflection on _Think Again_ by [Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net/), who's already a very renowned professor teaching at Wharton, and also a bestselling author of multiple books about psychology and organization.

## Prologue

- Even lives (example of smokejumpers) can be saved if we avoid the traditional thinking and try to think something novel.
- Students tend to score more correctly on the questions on which they revise the answers.
- There's a reason why people are reluctant to rethinking: _we hesitate at the very idea of rethinking._
- But rethinking would allow you to be _better positioned for success at work and happiness in life._

> Thinking again can help you generate new solutions to old problems and revisit old solutions to new problems.

## Part I. Individual Rethinking: Updating our own views

### Chapter 1. A Preacher, a Prosecutor, a Politician, and a Scientist Walk into Your Mind

- BlackBerry's initial success and its following failure to adapt to (rethink) the rapidly changing landscape in the smartphone market demonostrates the true importance of rethinking.
- Second thoughts: we often favor feeling right over being right, and we need to fix that.
- "we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians."
  - **preachers**: 
    - our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. 
    - changing mind is a moral weakness.
  - **prosecutors**: 
    - we marshal arguments to prove others wrong and win our case.
    - changing mind is admitting defeat.
  - **politicians**:
    - we seek to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents.
    - changing mind is flip-flopping in response to carrots and sticks
  - **all these mindsets don't leave a room for rethinking.**
- A different pair of goggles: _be a **scientist**._ It helps you find the **truth**. Always favor this mode of thinking over that of preachers, prosecutors, and politicians.
  - doubt what you know
  - be curious about what you don't know
  - update views based on new data.
  - changing mind is a sign of intellectual integrity
- Scientifically rethinking entrepreneurs earned more revenue than others in an experiment.
- The smarter they are, the harder they fail: 
  - confirmation bias: seeing what's expected
  - desirability bias: seeing what's wanted
  - "I'm not biased" bias: people beleive they're more object than others.

- Don't stop unbelieving: there's a rethinking cycle: humility, doubt, curiosity and discovery. _**if knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom**_.

- iPhone had the worst reception by Steve Jobs when the idea was first pitched, because it would get in the way of iPod (but think now: anyone uses iPod now?).

### Chapter 2. The Armchair Quarterback and the Impostor: Finding the Sweet Spot of Confidence

- Anton's syndrome: patients don't mentally recognize they are physically blind. Just like this, our blindness in knowledge may give us false confidence in judgement, preventing us from rethinking.
- A tale of two syndromes: 
  - Halla ran for presidency in Iceland despite her disbelief in her own ability and experience.
  - Armchair quarterback syndrome: confidence exceeds competence (in this case, the governor of the central bank, who had no fiannce or econ background)
  - Imposter syndrome: competence exceeds confidence (in this case, Halla, who wasn't convinced of her competence although she had enough)
  - The ideality is in the middle of armchair quarterback and an impostor syndrome.
- The ignorance of arrogance: Dunning-Kruger effect. **When we lack competence, we are likely to be overconfient.** If you lack actual intelligence, you overestimate your intelligence.

> The first rule of the Dunning-Kurger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.

- Stupid: 
  - Armchair quarterback simply gets in the way of rethinking. People with this syndrome wouldn't just accept they are less competent. Their egos defend them. Unable to think about their own thinking.
  - Oddsson lacked **humility** and valued **arrogance**.
- What goldilocks got wrong: 
  - Targeting enough amount of confidence is not right. 
  - Humility is often misunderstood as low confidence
  - The sweet spot of confidence is humility + confidence.
