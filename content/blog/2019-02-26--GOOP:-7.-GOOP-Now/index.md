# Past
I worked on [GOOP](https://goop.ai)'s project together with Jeff & Peter even before they started building a service. You can see my related posts on that. 

I had to go to the military after providing the design and the website for Goop. So I could no longer work for Goop after like 2017 June. That was it. A job only for a month. And now I became curious on how Goop's doing, so I checked on them.

## Present
As of now, GOOP has been pretty successful! 
GOOP has:
- penetrated more than 1/3 of the population in HKU
- [been downloaded 10K+ times on Google Play](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goop-where-good-friends-stay/id1260299914?ls=1&mt=8). Stats not shown on App Store. 
- [got 1K+ likes on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/goop4groups/?ref=goop). 

Yeah, true that. I have only contributed at the beginning for the logo, design, and landing page, but it was really a worthwhile experience, looking back--especially because Goop has made such a success now.
