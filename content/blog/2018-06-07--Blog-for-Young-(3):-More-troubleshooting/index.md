## Error
I kept getting this error, greatly increasing the loading speed for the website:

Now the website looks like this right now

But it keeps throwing me an error. 

Everything loads perfectly except in regards to speed.

So the error from the console is this one:

```javascript
grommet.min.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
    at Object.<anonymous> (grommet.min.js:1)
    at t (grommet.min.js:1)
    at Object.<anonymous> (grommet.min.js:26)
    at t (grommet.min.js:1)
    at Object.<anonymous> (grommet.min.js:1)
    at t (grommet.min.js:1)
    at grommet.min.js:1
    at grommet.min.js:1
```

and I found that this is related to.. either `import` or webpack:

* [might be webpack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32070303/uncaught-referenceerror-react-is-not-defined)
* [might be import problem](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/solved-uncaught-reference-error-react-not-defined)

And I think this link might help as well:

* [github: importing jQuery in nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/1465)
* [github grommet sample](https://github.com/grommet/next-sample)

These are the things that I have done to solve the problem:

1. Check if all `.js` files that use `react` have `import` statements. 
2. Search more...

And I found this:
1. I was referring to `grommet.min.js` from a CDN. 
2. And this was not right, as this source was referring to `React` while it was just put inside `<head>` tag. It could not refer to `React`. 
3. So I did this to `_document.js`:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Document, { Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import "../static/grommet-dxc.min.css"
import "../static/style.css"
import Grommet from "grommet"

export default class CustomDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <html>
        <Head>
        {/* This is going to be your global head */}
          <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "/_next/static/style.css" />
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
          <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Work+Sans:300,400,700" rel="stylesheet"/>
          <script src = {Grommet.grommetux}></script>
        </Head>
        
        <body>
          <Main /> {/* each routed page will go inside here */}
          <NextScript /> {/* You don't have to care about this. */}
          
        </body>
      </html>
    )
  }
}
```

Now the project runs perfectly without the reference error!

## Another error
Another one was this:

```
warning.js:33 Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <a> in <article>.
```

well, this one...

I found on github that this is just a warning and it does not show up on actualy production. So I ran the production server:

```
next build
next start -p 8080 # c9.io only supports port 8080 for node.js
```

and no error happened. So all errors have been solved.

## Another error after I installed eslint
[Solution on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46840646/eslint-complaining-about-getinitialprops)

All things set correctly, I still got an error on `getInitialProps` when I ran eslint:
```
/home/ubuntu/workspace/pages/_error.js
  6:16  error  Parsing error: Unexpected token getInitialProps

âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```
And so I installed `babel-eslint` and added this line in `.eslintrc.json`: 
```
"parser": "babel-eslint",
```

and it complained no more.
