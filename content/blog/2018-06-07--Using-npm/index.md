## Uninstall
```
npm uninstall [package]
```

## Uninstall and remove it from project dependency
```
npm --save uninstall [package]
```

## Uninstall and remove it from dev dependency
```
npm --save-dev uninstall [package]
```

## How to change a devDependency to dependency
```
npm install [package] --save-prod
```

## How to change dependency to devDependecy
```
npm install [package] --save-dev
```

## How to check if a dependency is being used
```
npm install -g npm-check

npm-check
```

and it will give you a nice outline of the things happening. This could give you a great insight of what to possibly `uninstall`.:

```
j031:~/workspace $ npm-check

@zeit/next-sass   ðŸ˜•  NOTUSED?  Still using @zeit/next-sass?
                               Depcheck did not find code similar to require('@zeit/next-sass') or import from '@zeit/next-sass'.
                               Check your code before removing as depcheck isn't able to foresee all ways dependencies can be used.
                               Use --skip-unused to skip this check.
                               To remove this package: npm uninstall --save @zeit/next-sass

                               To remove this package: npm uninstall --save-dev path

Use npm-check -u for interactive update.
```

## Check if a module is installed
```
npm list --depth=0 | grep <module_name>
```

## Dealing with errors

```
npm ERR! peer dep missing: react@^15.0.0, required by react-youtube-autocomplete@1.0.20
npm ERR! peer dep missing: react-dom@^15.0.0, required by react-youtube-autocomplete@1.0.20
npm ERR! peer dep missing: ajv@^6.0.0, required by ajv-keywords@3.2.0
npm ERR! peer dep missing: react@^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0-0, required by react-typeahead-component2@0.10.2
```

Ahhhh what is this error. 

I looked into [version expression convention on npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004).

well first, the caret `^` means:

> Allows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the [major, minor, patch] tuple. 

Some examples from the website:
```
^1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <2.0.0
^0.2.3 := >=0.2.3 <0.3.0
^0.0.3 := >=0.0.3 <0.0.4
```

So from my errors, I find that:
```
react@^15.0.0 is >=15.0.0 <16.0.0 
react-dom@^15.0.0 is >=15.0.0 <16.0.0
ajv@^6.0.0 is >=6.0.0 < 7.0.0
react@^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0-0 is >=0.14.0 <0.2.0 or >=15.0.0 <16.0.0
```
So essentially I had to install something like:
```
react@15.6.2
react-dom@15.6.2
ajv@6.5.1
```

So like:
```
npm install --save react@15.6.2 react-dom@15.6.2 ajv@6.5.1
```

and the errors were gone!
