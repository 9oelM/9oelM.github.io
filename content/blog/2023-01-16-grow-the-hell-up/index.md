_Grow the hell up._

_Grow the hell up._

_Grow the hell up._

Yeah, I really need to grow the hell up. I've been telling this to myself the whole day.

I need to confess that I still have numerous things in my life that I am surely able to change, but have been putting mediocre effort into actually changing it.

If you want changes, you gotta push hard. Like real hard.

Take responsibilities.

Don't indulge in, but despise foolish, useless habits.

Resiliently achieve the goals.
