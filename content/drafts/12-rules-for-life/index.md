# Foreword (vii-xxvii)

- Question: Why even expect more rules in our lives anyways, while it seems pretty clear that people don't like rules? (vii)

- Answer: 
  
  > But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we _quickly become slaves to our passions - and there's nothing freeing about that._ (viii)

Most people don't like rules. But they live in a chaos, and they don't like themselves being in a chaos too. That's the reason they would need a set of rules to live against.

Short introduction to Jordan as an 'erudite', 'practical', renowned, and knowledgeable person. (~xiv)

Jordan's first book _Maps of Meaning_ explains why and how we do things that we do today, to deal with uncertainty and the unavoidable unknown. It contains somewhat more complex concepts, which _12 Rules of Life_ actually based upon. (~xv)

Young people actually have an hunger for rules. They've been taught two contradicting ideas at schools, which left them just confused on what's right or wrong (xx). One major school of thought is that "morality is relative, at best a personal 'value judgement'." There is no absolute right or wrong in anything. Even more extreme: postmodernist left's argument that a group's morality is nothing but its attempt to exercise power over another group (xxii). Therefore, the best way to live, is to simply tolerate and respect different ways of living a life. But it turns out that **people in moral relativism can't live without a moral compass** (~xxiii).

While modern response to different rules of different societies was relativism, nihilism or ideology, the ancient Greeks endevoured to search for the reasons and ideas intertwined with those rules. Aristotle found one striking similarity across these societies too: while the rules differed, human beings have a tendency to make rules, laws and customs. (~xxv)

> It seems that all human beings are, by some kind of biological endowment, so ineradicably concenred with morality that we create a structure of laws and rules wherever we are. **The idea that human life can be free of moral concerns is a fantasy.** (xxv)

> We are rule generators. And given that we are moral animals, what must be the effectt of our simplistic modern relativism upon us? It means that **we are hobbling ourselves by pretending to be something we are not.** (xxv)

# Overture (xxviii-)

Jordan first started to answer some questions about ilfe on Quora, and started to get some popularity there. In 2013, he started to upload videos of his lectures at university, which got popular too. (~xxx)

Later he was suggested to write a guide on 'how to live well', and the proposal was acceptede by Penguin Random House. (~xxxviii)

The title was picked as so because it's clear that we need rules. We need order. But chaos exists too, which hinder us from being in an order. 

> If we each live properly, we will collectively flourish. (xxxix)

# Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back (1)

## Lobsters - and territory

Lobsters have a simple nervous systems which could be thoroughly studied by scientists (1). This helps us understand how our brain and behavior function too.

Lobsters want a secure, reliable and sustainable home where prey is abundant. What happens when multiple lobsters want the same space? The same happens for songbirds. (2)

## Birds - and territory

Wrens would warn and fight you when you get into their territory. Both wrens and lobsters are obsessed with status and position.

Also important for chickens too: the location (proximity to prey) of chicken determines its priority in getting the food, thus the survival.

> The wiliest, strongest, healthiest and most fortunate birds occupy prime territory, and defend it. Because of this, they are more likely to attract high-quality mates, and to hatch chcisk who survive and thrive. (4)

A pandemic across birds would kill the least dominant and the most vulnerable birds first. Same for human societies. 

Territorial conflict imposes a problem: how to win or lose without the disagreeing parties incurring too great a cost (because the winner might be hurt even after winning, which means the 3rd bird can come in and take the space). (4)

## Conflict - and territory

A defated wolf shows its subordination to a victor by a specific gesture. Dolphins make certain sounds to reduce conflict between dominant and subordinate group members. Many other animals behave like so. (5)

Lobsters too. They want a safe place to hide. The place may be scarce. When two lobsters competing for the same spot encounter each other, they spout chemicals containing information of size, sex, health, and mood out to each other. (6) If a lobster finds that the opponent is too big, it will just retreat.

Otherwise, lobsters will try to flip the other on its back. Once they do it, the flipped one will generally give up and leave. 

Otherwise, they will physically fight. Typically, they will have a winner here. The once dominant brain will phyiscally replace itself with a subordinate brain. (8)

Victors will have high serotonin and low octopamine, and losers the reverse. (8-9)

> (Winner lobster) ... is a coky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less liekly to back down when challenged. ... (the loser lobster is) ... a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners ... (8-9)

## The principle of unequal distribution (9)

The defeated lobster is more likely to lose in the next fight. The winning lobster, the reverse. Similarly: 

- majority of scientific papers are published by a small % of scientists
- majority of commercial music is composed by a small % of musicians
- 500 books sell more than 100,000 books in the US.
- Four classical composers wrote almost all the music played by modern ochestras.

This is known as Price's law. Anyways, nature has produced a very simple and efficient mechanism for a hierarchy of lobsters. The winner takes it all, the loser can't get anything. (10-11)

## All the girls (11)

Female lobsters naturally get attracted to dominant (winning) lobsters (the most efficient, correct way to identify the best man)

The dominant lobster gets all the girls too.

The dominance hierarchy of lobsters exhibit the same features as the environment to which all complex life has adapted. **Lobsters have existed from a really long time ago only with a very simple nervous system, but they still had a mechanism to think about status and society** (13).

## The nature of nature (13)

Nature is not a simple thing.

- It is dynamic: as the environment changes, the faetures that make a given individual successful in surviving and reproducing also transform and change. So natural selection is not "creatures matching themselves ever more precisely to a template specified by the world", but a very interactive process between the nature and the world.
- It is static: some things change less quickly. "Leaves change more quickly than trees, and trees more quickly than forests." (15)

There exists an ancient and fundamental part in our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy: the reason we act like lobsters when we are defeated. Weak people exhibit low levels of serotoin, thus much of stress and vulnerability to illness, death and depression. (18)

## Top and Bottom (18)

If you are at the top, you get all of the best parts: good counterpart, health, opportunities, ... If you are at the botttom, you don't get anything. Terrible food, nowhere to live, poor mental and physical conditions, etc. We are not talking about possessing money here; it's just about a general human life (18-19)

'The ancient part of the brain' will watch how other people treat you. If they treat you badly, it will incur low serotonin level. This process burns up a lot of energy. It's called **stress**. (19)

> This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It 's a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. (19)

If you are already stressed, even the smallest external stimuli will cause chains of negative reactions in your mental and physical state, making you de-energized, impulsive, etc.

If you are at the top (not stressed), you already know you are safe and all good, so chances of you being damanged from a threat is substantially low. **The result is that you still stay clam, tall, straight, and confident**. (20)

## Malfunction (20)

#### Sleeping and eating

Inconsistent patterns of sleeping and eating can cause a stress too. The body needs to "function like a well-rehearsed orchestra"

**Your sleeping and eating schedule need to be consistent in order to keep you out of chaos!** 

> It is for such reasons that I always ask my clinical clients first about sleep. ... If the answer is no, fixing thatt is the first thing I recommend.
> 
> The next thing I ask about is breakfast. ... eat a fat and protein-heavy breakfastt as soon as possible after they are awaken.

Having a fat, protein-heavy breakfast ASAP will prevent you from having a high insulin level that will make you psychologically unstable. (20-21)

#### Complex positive feedback loop

1. You feel vulnerable
2. You do something bad in order to fix that
3. You feel better
4. Some time later, you feel vulnerable because of something bad you did in order to fix it
5. Then you do something bad again
6. And so on.

Example: **alcohol addiction**. A person drinks an alcohol. Makes him happy. When he stops drinking, he will feed bad due to metabolization and secretion of toxins. To remove that bad feeling, he will just resume drinking. After that, the hungover goes on again, and then it can be temporarily handled with a few more drinks. It will go on and on.

Another example: agoraphobia or experience of being bullied. Just functions in the same mechanism as alcohol addiction.

**Continuation of these bad habits or psychological state will only lead to itself again!** (-26)

## Rising Up

![1](./1.jpeg)

Stop being in a defeated posture (30)

> Maybe you are a loser. And maybe you are not - but if you are, you don't have to continue in that mode. Maybe you just have a bad habit. Maybe you're even just a collection of bnad habits. Nonetheless, even if you came by your poor posture honestly - even if you were unpopular or bullied at home or in grade school - it's not necessarily appropriate now. Circumstances change. **If you slump around, with the same bearing that characterizes a defeated lobster, people will assign you are lower status, and the old counter that you share with crustaceans, sitting at the very base of your brain, will assign you a low dominance number.** (30)

Standing up straight with shoulders back has not only physical but also psychological implications.

> Circumstances change, and so can you.  ... if you present yourself as defeated, then people will react to you as if you are losing. If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently. ... But **standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only phyiscal, because you;re not only a body. You're a spirit, so to speak - a psyche - as well.**  (31)

Life is terrible, but standing up straight with shoulders back means confidently accepting that and trying to improve it.

> To stand up ... is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, ... means deciding to boluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. ... means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, .... 
> 
> **So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around.** (32)

Then, people will start to perceive you as a dominant being. Why not try it first and see how it goes before even going into defeated mode? (33)

# Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping (35)

## Why won't you just take your damn pills? (35)

- people tend to miss out on taking the pills for various reasons, both unintendedly and intendedly. (35)

- even some people going on a kidney transplantation surgery - they won't be able to go on with the best surgery if they just don't take their pills. But why? (36)

- when it comes to giving pills to the pets, people tend to do it much better. You will actually do your best to get them pills. 
  
  > In fact, on average, you care more. People are better at filling and properly administering prescription medication to their pets than to themselves. (37)

- But why?

## The Oldest Story and the Nature of the World (38)

- Two stories of creation are introduced in Genesis (38):
  
  - The 'Priestly' version:
    
    - God created the world with his speech.
  
  - The 'Jawhist' version 

- In the modern world, we base our thoughts on scientific truths quite naturally, but that is absolutely not the case in the past (38)
  
  > Being was understood as **a place of action**, not a place of things. It was understood as something more akin to story or drama (39)
  
  - subjective experience can be related more to a novel or a movie than to a science. (39)

## The Domain, Not of Matter, but of What Matters (40)

- The scientific world of matter can be reduced to some fundamental concepts (40)

- The world of experience can be too, to **chaos, order, and consciousness**. (40)
  
  - chaos and order cause us to doubt the validity of existence, but consciousness leads to "the real way out".

Chaos (40)

- is..
  
  > The foreginer, the tranger, the member of another gang, ... the monster under the bed, the hidden anger of your mother, and the sickness of your child. ... the despair and horror you feel .. where we are when we don't know where we are, and what we are doing when we don't know what we are doing.

- is **all those things and situations we neither know nor understand.**

Order (41)

- is:
  
  > explored territory. position and authority. structure of society. tribe, religion, hearth, home and country. the value of the currency. plan for the day. politeness. ...

- **where everything is certain.**

- Where there is an order, there is chaos. (43)

- Our brains are wired to repond instantly to chaos. (43)

## Chaos and Order: Persnoality, Female and Male

- So far, it's been explained why **chaos and order** are two most fundamental elements of lived experience (Being). Chaos and order are perceived as **personalities** as well. (43-44)

- Perception of things as entities with personality occurs before perception of things as things. This works the same for order and chaos. They are personified first, and then perceived as things and objects. (44)

- Therefore, the most significant elements of our environment of origin were peronsalities, not things, objects or situations. (44)

- The personalities majorly have been split into **male** and **female** for a billion years, since when there has been separate sexes (44).

- Naturally, the category of **parent** and **child** has existed for a long time too, unavoidably deeply embedded into our psychology (44)

- We are social and we care about other creatures, which can be translated as environment. (45)

- Our brain also has a capacity to have knowledge about the nature of the world, or the objective world. We grew to **deal with** what's **outside** of what we currently understand. (45)

- When we first started doing this, we used categories representing pre-human animal social world, which is even older than our species. It can be said that the most basic category is the sex: **male** and **female**.
  
  > We appear to hhave taken that primordial knowledge of structured, creative opposition (male and female) and begun to interpret everything through its lens (46)

### Order (46)

- is: masculinity, yang of the Taoist yin-yang symbol, men throughout history have been the builders of towns and cities, engineers, stonemasons, bricklayers ..., God the Father, ledgerkeeper, policemen and soldiders, ...

### Chaos (46)

- is: feminine. possibility, the source of ideas, mysterious realm of gestation and birth. the darkness of a cave and the accident by the side of the road. it's the mother grizzly that tears you to pieces. crushing force of sexual selection. 

### Duality of masculinity and feminity (47-)

- Many religious symbols share masculinity and feminity at the same time:
  
  - The Star of David
  
  - the yoni and lingam of Hinduism
  
  - Fuxi and Nuwa in China
  
  - the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child
  
  - androgyny of Christ

- The structure of the brain also reflects this duality (48): 
  
  > the hemispheric structure of the cortex reflects the fundamental division between novelty (the unknown, or chaos) and routinization (the known, order)

- We all know this, but we don't know we know it. **We eternally inhabit order, surroundded by chaos.** (49) (This sentence is what really sums up the last few pages)

- Chaos and order is anywhere in our lives, and the balance between chaos and order is crucial. Being inclined on either side too much may cause a problem. Neither shouldn't exist too. The same applies for other living things (50-51)

## The Garden of Edens (51)

- As previously mentioned, Genesis was combined from multiple sources:
  
  - Chapter 1: 'Priestly' story (refer back to 38)
    
    - Naturally connects to Chapter 2, suggesting someone or some people carefully attached these two stories together
  
  - Chapter 2: 'Jahwist' story (52)
    
    - Uses the name YHWH (Jahweh) to describe God
    
    - Contains the story of Adam and Eve
    
    - Adam was instructed not to touch or eat the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, but he did
    
    - Adam and Eve were not self-conscious: they were naked but not ashamed.

- Chapter 3 has a serpent appearing. While **God only knows why it's inside the garden**,**the serpent appears to play the role of chaos, and the paradise that of order.** (53)

- Where there is an order, there has to be a chaos, _because nothing can be completely walled off from the rest of reality._ (54)

- The absence of chaos would also be problematic: _how could the nature of man ever reach its full potential without challenge and danger?_ (54)

- Anyway, Eve eats the forbidden fruit, and becomes self-conscious. (55-56)

## The Naked Ape

>  What does it mean to know yourself (and your partner) naked?

- Naked means: vulnerable, easily damanged, subject to judgement for beauty and health, unprotected, unarmed. (57)

- But that doesn't mean we can justly resent or hate the Ideal: knowledgeable, accomplished mathematicians should not disappear just because of my poor math skills. (58)

- God spots Adam and Eve being self-conscious, and punishes them with 'having to work' and pregnancy respectively, and they are expelled from Paradise, out into the unknown, chaotic world. (59-61)

- Back to the original query (at 35): why would someone buy prescription medication for his dog, and carefully administer it, and not do the same for himself?

- Answer: why should take care of anything as naked, ugly, ashamed, ... as a descendant of Adam, even if that being is himself? Actually, you are the one who knows the most about yourself, your transgressions, insufficiencies and inadequacies. No one else has more reason to regard you as a pathetic man. **And by witholding something that might do you good (the medication), you can punish yourself for all your failings. A harmless, innocent, unselfconscious dog is more deserving.** (61) 

## Good and Evil (62)

- Dogs and cats are predetors: they kill things and eat them. But we still own them as pets and give them meds when they're sick. (62)

- Why?: because they are predators by nature, without self-conscious. No comprehension of their weakness, vulnerability, pain, and death.

- Humans?: they know. **we know exactly how and where we can be hurt, and why.** _This is as good a definition as any of self-consciousness._

- We can do a lot with that: feel pain, disgust, shame, horror, terrify, humiliate, torture, ... **only man will inflict suffering for the sake of suffering.** *That is the best definition of evil I have been able to formulate.* (63)

- Man can make things worse voluntarily. This validates the idea of Original Sin: who could deny it with the sense of inbuilt corruption and capacity for wrongdoing? (63)

- **No one understands the darkness of the individual better than the individual himself. Who, then, when ill, is going to be fully commited to his own care?** (64)

## A Spark of the Divine

- It might not simply be the self-consciousness that makes us doubt our own worth. Perhaps it is [instead] **our unwillingness - reflected in Adam's shamed hiding - to walk with God, despite our fragility and propensity for evil. (66)**

- We don't take care of ourselves because we know we are fallen creatures. (67)

- 2000 years ago, people were much more barbaric than any peoples in the world right now: arena sports, human (child) sacrifice, ... And right now, aggressive people will just go to jail. Unacceptable. (67-68)

- Widespread belief: people are arrogant and selfish.

- But at the same time, they have exceeding amounts of self-disgust, self-contempt, shame and self-consciousness. **This is the reason they don't value themselves at all** instead of caring of their own importance. Really, they are aware of their own faults and inadequacies, ashamed and doubtful of their own value. 
  
  >  **They believe that other people shouldn't suffer, and they will work diligently and altruistically to help them alleviate it. They extend the same courtesy even to the animals they are acquainted with - but not so easily to themselves.** (68)

- Self-sacrifice is well presented by the Christ. But it does not mean to suffer more than what is offered in return. If so, it's just a slave and a tyrant in a relationship.

- Standing up and speaking for yourself and someone else have almost no difference, because anyone is stumbling, sinful and imperfect anyways. (69)

- you don't have a right to torture and mistreat yourself, because: 
  
  - God claims you don't belong to yourself
  
  - Your Being affects others (i.e. suicide)
  
  - We have a spark of the divine in us which belongs to God

- People in fact have overwhelming, unexpected and miraculous ability to  overcome difficulties (i.e. those with severely sick conditions or close ones with the equivalent). It's just amazing how all people go through troubles and make a way out of that all by themselves despite mortal vulnerability, tyranny of the state, and depredations of nature. (70-71)

- Therefore, **humanity deserves some serious respect**. Everyone deserves respect, and you also. (71)
  
  > You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. **You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.** ... to treat yourself as if you were someone you are reponsible for helping is, instead, **to consider what would be truly good for you.** (72)

- good vs happy: what makes you happy isn't what's good in most cases and we all know that (72)

- always think about what would be good for me and the ways to achieve that. (72-73)

- set a **vision** and **direction** for nobody but yourself (73)



# Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you (77)

## The old hometown (77)

- JBP lived in Fairview, Alberta and it was super cold especially in the winter, and the cats (home-grown ones too) faced the risk of death often due to their behavior to seek heat under coldness. (77-79)

## My Friend Chris and His Cousin (79)

- His friends Chris and Ed were young delinquent people doing stupid things that teenagers do, including marijuana. (79-81)

## Teenage Wasteland (81)

- JP and his friends often went to creepy parties, and no one knew what they were doing there (81)
- Not so many families in Alberta decided to send their kids to universities and that wasn't because of financial concerns (82
  )

## Some different friends - and some more of the same (83)

- JP made a road trip with his friends, Carl and Chris, pretty far away from Alberta, and did the same stupid thing there, just drinking and wasting time. (84)
- When they all grew up, JP expected Chris and Ed to be actually grown up, but that wasn't the case. (85)
- Their lives were going really creepy, with nothing being achieved. Just the same people JP saw when he was a teenager. (85)
- Chris, Carl and Ed had every chance to improve their lives, but they didn't do so. (86)
- Chris ended up committing suicide. (86)

> Such people just refuse the responsibility of their lives and choose to get acquainted with the men of similar kind. (86)

- Freud calls this 'repetition compulsion', an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past. (87)

## Rescuing the damned (87)

- Trying to help people in such difficulties is not an easy job at all (87)
- Often, the motivation to help is vanity, narcissism, a desire to draw attention to one's own compassion and good-will (91)
- The person that you are trying to help maybe had thousands of chances to improve but didn't, making his life worse every second (91-92)

> You're associating with people whoare bad for you not because it's better for everyone, but because it's easier.

- Before helping someone, identify that he is really in trouble (92)
- Failure is easy to understand, but it shouldn't be a valid excuse. (92)
- It's very likely that a person intentionally chose to reject the path upward. They use their misery as a proof for the world's injustice (92-93)
- You don't have to and probably shouldn't befriend them. (93)

## A Reciprocal Arrangement (95)

- If you have a friend you wouldn't recommend to your sister or others, why would you befriend him yourself (95)
- Good friends will let you know you're doing good when you are, and bad when you are doing bad. (95)

# Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today

- No matter how good you are at something, there must be someone better than you (99)

- Some few people in the world win and take the most, and our internal, contemtuous view of ourselves hurts our mind. (100-101)

- Just stop listening. There will always be people better than you and you can't change that. (101)

## Many good names (101)

- The good and the bad (outcomes) certainly exist when you work on something. So how can we still ignore this critical self consciousness on the outcome or abilities? (101)

- We shouldn't have a binary view on success and failure (102)

- There are multiple 'games' in life, some of which you are good at, some not. You can select the ones that you match. (102-103)

- It's not that there is a single game. Consider judging success across all games you are playing (103)

- Games are usually quite specific to you, so comparison is simply inappropriate. Some people value something more than you do and less too. (103)

- The way that the internal critic, when investigated, is not objective and credible. (103-104)

- As we grow up, we become increasingly unique from others, which gives a valid reason we can't be compared with others. (104)

- Maybe you don't know yourself very well. Do you ask what you want, negotiate fairly with yourself, or are you a tyrant, with yourself as a slave? (104-105)

- You should take up a responsibility for yourself. (105)

- You should be truthful and honest to yourself. Know what you are doing. (105-106)

- You know what you need, what you need to do, when you lie about to yourself, how much time you need to spend on that and that, ... when you pause for a second and think about it. It's all on you. Therefore, comparing yourself to others can't make sense there because everything is very unique to you (106-107)

## The Point of Our Eyes (or, Take Stock) (107)

- We are always aiming at something, and trying to move towards the goal, the better future. (107-108)

- The present can't be changed, but the future can. _Take stock (of yourself)._ Take stock of your psychological house and inspect which parts are flawed. You must start from there because you need to learn to embrace your own flaws. (108-109)

- The future could be better. The present is an eternal failure. Therefore,  try to make the future better. (109)

- When you use the internal critic properly, you will be able to fix things. Negotiate with yourself and use yourself. (110)

- Do a real deal with yourself, just like you do with others, if you can't easily fix your own flaws, like compensating yourself with a cup of coffee when you get things fixed or done (110-111)

> A little careful kindness goes a long way, and judicious reward is a powerful motivator. Then you could take that small bit of yourself by  the hand and **do the damn dishes.** (111)

- How can you know that you are improving, with what standard? First, aim small. If you are just beginning on this whole thing, just set a small goal for the day, and reward you if you do it. Then.. repeat that. (111)

## What You Want and What You See (112)

- People wouldn't be able to see interferences when focusing on something they are paying attention to. That's how we deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world: by ignoring it. (112-114)

- It's the same thing when you work towards a goal. You ignore most things except your goal and obstacles. Therefore, you must choose what you must (consciously) see because there are many things out there (114)

- You have a system built into yourself to faciliate the screening process of things to recognize, which is quite hard to amend. But sometimes you should because you are not seeing the things that you should be seeing. (115-116)

- Stop for a second and think what you really need: it may be in your subconsciousness. Find it, and aim for it. (116-117)

- You will start to learn to see what's _better_, if you genuinely want your life to improve (117-118)

- Begin from articulating, priortizing and arranging your desires because they tell you a lot (118-119)

- Religion is about proper behavior (good and evil). An acolyte will first try to be a good person instead of thinking too hard because that's what he has to do anyways. It's the same for us: that drive to behave for the better needs to be present. (119-120)

- What we see is dependent upon our religious beliefs, even for those who think themselves as atheists (120-121)

- Careful observation can show your beliefs. These come from incredibly complex chains of thoughts and processes, all the way from the antiquity. Some beliefs come from fundamental teachings from the cultures, including the Bible (121)

## Old Testament God and New Testament God (122)

- People seem to think of the Old Testament God as a harsh and dangerous God, and the New Testament God as a forgiving and loving God. (122)

- But the benevolent God is much less believable, in the world of post-Auushwitz, where terrible things happen (123-124)

- It's the same for our lives. We are so helpless in our lives, often lost and can't control ourselves. It might as well be better for our lives if we decide to serve Old Testament God. (125)

- Keep trying to do better. To do that, you need to pay attention (126)

## Pay attention (126)

- Just stop and think about what's bothering you, what might give you motivation, and so on (126-127)

- Set the tasks for a day in the morning, and reward yourself once you achieve them (127-128)

> Realization is dawning. Instead of playing the tyrant, therefore, you are paying attention. You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world. You are negotiating, instead of playing the martyr or the tyrant ... You are discovering who you are, and what you want, and what you are willing to do. ... Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good. ... Now, your trajectory is heavenward. (129)

# Rule 5: Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them (133)

## Actually, it's not OK (133)

- Some parents leave their children behave carelessly in public (133-134)

- There may be cultural and biological (evolutionary) reasons of favouring male over female children (135-136)

- Preferential treatment to an adolescent son may bring about an attractive, well-rounded, confident man. (136)

- However, sometimes, unconscious (or conscious) hatred can prevent parents from giving enough concern to a child (137-138)

## Everybody hates arithmetic (138)

- Small quotidian concerns are insidious, and it certainly takes up a lot of your time. JP had a client who had to spent hours per month to get his son to sleep after fighting (138)

- Is it the fault of the child or the parent? Despite it being easy for children to attribute it to the parents, it might as well be children's fault (139)

- There has been a growing social view from 1960 that parents should only be benevolent, and not be pursuing discipline, order and conventionality, leaving immaturity of the children behind. (139-140)

- A philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that children have an intrinsically unsullied spirit, damaged only by culture and society (141)

- There are dozens of evidences that that claim is not true. Even chimpanzees murder each other very often. Look at Japanese invation over China and its brutal covert human experiments. Many cities, both uncivilized and civilized, exhibit substantial homicide rate too. (142-143)

- Even if children are deemed to be good, they can't be left alone and expected to suddenly bloom into perfection. Even dogs must be trained to be in the pack. Then how much should children be given their overwhelming complexity compared to dogs. (143-144)

> Children must be shaped and informed, or they cannot thrive (144)

- Children are damaged when they are just left with full freedom, without any discipline or care, and they are often ignored by their peers because they are poorly socialized (144-145)

## Parent or Friend (145)

- Parents neglect discplinary approaches for the fear of themselves not being liked or loved anymore, or for deliberate reasons. **This is not good.**(145)

- If parents act like this, that means they want friendship with their children. Friends are very easy to ignore and have a limited authority  for discipline (145)

> It is an act of responsibility to discpline a child. (146)

- It's true that it's difficult to discipline a child. But disregarding such a duty will produce irresponsible, helpless adults. Discipline also does not harm creativity. Children will keep trying to draw attentions by doing useless things from adults if not controlled (146-147)

- Provocative, immature children will cause problems and even try to dominate their parents (147-148)

- Children are just trying to scout the boundary of permissible behaviors in taking their provoking actions. It's important to let them know the boundary once they do (148)

# Reflections

## Freedom

> But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we _quickly become slaves to our passions - and there's nothing freeing about that._ (viii)

This is the exact same thing the book _Atomic Habits_ suggests. If you make a habit (or in the context of this book, a _rule_ in your life), it is rather going to free you. For example, if you make a habit to save money, it will going to give you more freedom in buying stuffs later when you need them, while on the surface it might seem like that habit is restricting you from buying anything.

Isn't it so ironic? Mere freedom doesn't grant you freedom. It curbs you instead. 

## Order and chaos

Everyone, if not consciously, at least should have an underlying sense of order and chaos in the corner of their minds. We know when things go ''unlike the plan'. We know when things go ''as planned'.

As JBP mentioned, such a phenomenon is unavoidable and already everywhere.

So what becomes important is what I do then. How much am I confident in surviving the world of order and chaos? How much am I ready and prepared in my mind to challenge myself with this?

## Happy vs Good

In Chapter 2, JBP says happy and good don't have a single common thing together. Never thought that way, but sounds so true when I read it.

I pursue a bunch of things daily that makes me happy. I would not recommend that my dog or my child (if I had one) do the same. But why am I doing that myself!? This is the moment I realized that I just need to stop all of this. I shouldn't be pursuing things that make me only happy.

*Good things* tend to last long. *Happy things* don't. I think that's one big difference. Watching a fun short clip on Youtube, for example, surely makes you happy, but it does not deserve to be said 'good' for you (or 'bad', it's just rather nothing but something that makes you happy)

## Treating myself like someone I am responsible for helping

This is absurdly _hard_. Even with the innately selfish human nature. Even after reading the chapter 2, I still keep asking myself: what the heck is going on? Why can't I care myself enough? Why did I miss breakfast so many times knowing that it wouldn't be good for my health? Why did I sleep late and wake up late knowingly? Why
