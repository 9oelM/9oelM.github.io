# Foreward by Jason Fried

- Execution and results are not everything. Most projects end up with demotivated people who don't want to do the same thing again.
- You don't have to use Waterfall, Agile, Scrum. It is an entirely different approach.
- This book is of _practice_, not theory.

# 1. Introduction

It's to be read by everyone at a company (10)

## Growing pains

Struggles appear as company grows (10): 
- Projects seem to have no end. They keep going on and on
- No time to think strategically about the product
- Can't develop as fast as early days

The writer experienced the common problems in a growing startup and devised a known-to-be-a-good-way. 

The book gives you two things (11):
1. Better language to describe and deal  with the risks, uncertainties, and challenges for product development
2. Processes usewd to make meaningful progress

## Six-week cycles

- 6 weeks are enough to build something meaningful
- no daily meetings, no roadmap rethinking every two weeks. Once decision is made, fully commit the six weeks on the same feature, same product. (12)

## Shaping the work

- before work is given to a team, _**the work is shaped**_. (12)
  - concrete enough on specs
  - abstract enough to work out interesting details themselves
- how much time dod we want to spend, how much is the idea worth? (12)

## Making teams responsible
- give full responsibility to a small team of designers and programmers. (12)
- define their own tasks, adjust scope, ..., which is different from other methodologies where managers give out work. (12)

## Targeting risk

Reduce risk in the shaping process by: 
1. solving open questions before we commit the project to a time box. Don't give a project to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies (14)
2. integrating design and programming early.

# 2. Principles of Shaping

- Wireframes are too **_concrete_**, but words are too **_abstract_** (15-16)

## Case study: the dot grid calendar

- Building a proper calendar is not easy. (16)
- It would have all those little requirements (16)
- Only 10% users used a calendar before.
- Specs set:
    1. List of events would appear below the calendar
    2. Clicking a day with dot would scroll the corresponding event for that day into view

- This was still abstract enough for designer's creative contribution.

## Propery 1: It's rough

Everyone can tell it's undone yet. Designers and programmers have enoguh room for using their own skills. (18)

## Property 2: It's solved
1. Main elements of the solution are there
2. There is a clear direction of the solution

## Property 3: It's bounded

It indicates what _not_ to do. (19)

## Who shapes

Creative, integrative, technical, design thinking, technically literate, critical generalist.

## Two tracks (19-20)

1. Shaping: shapers will work on shaping for the next six weeks
2. Building: others will build what's been shaped previously

## Steps to shaping
1. **Set boundaries**: time and definition (range) of the problem.
2. **Rough out the elements**: sketching a solution at higher level of abstraction than wireframes
3. **Address risks and rabbit holes**: maybe there are parts missed out. Find those parts.
4. **Write the pitch**: summarizes the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations.
