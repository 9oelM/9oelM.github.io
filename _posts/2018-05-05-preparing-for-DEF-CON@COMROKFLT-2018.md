## Problem 
Well, obviously there will be a DEF CON@COMROKFLT about three weeks later. This one will be particular; it is a joint DEF CON between the U.S Navy and the ROK Navy. The paper says koreans and americans will together form several teams.
But I do not even know how to use hacking/forensic tools. And I do not know about the type of questions that usually come up for this kind of conference. 

## Information is everything
### So I first started searching on information on previous DEF CONs:

* [News article on ROKA DEF CON](http://www.ulsanfocus.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=110529)
* [Another news article on ROKA DEF CON](http://www.boannews.com/media/view.asp?idx=68388)

> "YESS팀은 침해당한 **Window PC의 VM(가상 이미지)**에 대한 침해사고 분석을 진행해 **악성코드가 실행된 시간, 동작과정 등을 분석한 후 침투 시나리오를 작성**하는 부분에서 뛰어난 실력을 인정받아 수상의 영광을 안았다."

### And I wanted to get some knowledge of digital forensics and hacking in reality:

* [Malware analysis tools by AhnLab](https://www.slideshare.net/youngjunchang14/ss-21477787?next_slideshow=1)

## How could I just learn all these tools in just three weeks?
