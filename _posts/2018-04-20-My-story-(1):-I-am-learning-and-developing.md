## Before starting to read this
People change. And so do I. This is a story of how I, as a developer and social being, changed over a course of time. 

## Who I was

### 1. Logical
Going back to middle and high school, I was a person of logical (+cynical, cold) personality. I tried to be as logical as possible for no clear reason for any decisions or human interactions such as conversations with my friends. 

I don't know exactly why I started to become like this. I don't remember when I started to have this personality. But when I looked into myself at some point, I became such a person. 

But I got along pretty well with those who were around myself. I saw things were going well, and I could do collaborative homework well too. 

I yet lacked an emotional or sensitive response from circumstances where I needed it. For example, when I was studying literature in either Korean or English, I could not express my feelings, or even feel that feelings well. I did not know what I was really writing when I was taking an exam on evaluating a poem or an essay. Because of that, sometimes I got a high grade for no clear reason that I don't even know, but many more times I got lower grades for the exam. And so I hated reading poems or novels. I could not understand why those things even existed in this world!  

### 2. I did not like indefinite, unclear subjects. 
Back to the poems, novel and essays -- they were not definite things. The interpretation of poems or novels could be A or B any time depending on contexts. If somebody thought the meaning of a title of some poem were 'life and death' because of some reason, that could be perfectly valid, while at the same time somebody would think otherwise for another valid reason. They were just not 'immutable' (to explain in a programmatic jargon). They were dynamic. Yeah. I did not like the things that were not constant on different contexts.   

### 3. Did not really put myself in other people's shoes
I said I was logical, but ironically I was short on this. I did not really understand, or tried to understand what people thought and why they behaved in such and such ways. 

Reflecting back to this time, this was partly because I did not experience enough. I had no really big troubles in my life. I did not have a cousin that I loved who died when I was 13. I did not have financial problems. I ate well, grew well, slept well. So to speak, I was too... uh.. 'clean'.  

### 4. Straight and plain talk
And I liked to talk straight and plain, without caring enough about how the listeners would feel and think about that. And I did not even know some people who had different personalities than I did were getting hurt from the words I spoke. 

But because I did not have an active emotion, I could not comfort somebody suitably.. or.. more exactly, I did not know how to comfort anybody. Liking to talk straight and plainly and talking to a friend to comfort him or her were completely different things. When a friend of mine would go through a bad, unwilling event, I could not really comfort him or her with some appropriate words. 

## Growing pains

### 1. At the university: a chance to reflect on my personality and talking habits
I met a range of more diverse people at the university. This was a place where I could learn a lot.

First, I recognized that there is some problem if I were to keep the same personality over my life. I could not understand others; I could not sympathise with others. Some of my friends that I newly made did not really like me talking straight and plain. 

This was just because I got to meet more different people. People from around the world, with their own experiences from their social, linguistic, whatever background. 

Moreover, some of those who I already knew back from my high school and came to the same university, while we had a brief chance to have an honest talk, told me that they got hurt from what I said in the past. My straight and plain talk were not something to be proud of but be ashamed of. Sometimes it could help (where necessary, like a business meeting), but it does not otherwise.  

And I got to know that I needed some improvement on my personality. This was essential if I wanted to work and be friends with the ones that have exactly opposite personalities from mine. 

But the problem was I did not know how. Some of my friends had highly respectful and amenable personalities. Even my dad does. But I did not know how I could just 'acquire' that. 

Well, as a brute-force solution, at first I just attempted to be nice for everybody. When my inner self said to me, 'do not do a favor for your friend because you are going to be tired.', I tried to ignore that and just did a favor for my friend. In a sense, I tried to be a nice person in an awkward and forced fashion. It was not natural. And in a programmatic term: not native. 

Yeah. My inner self and.. my 'outer' self were just just in line with each other. And that was the biggest problem. Being a nice person was not easy as I expected. 

### 2. At the university: got really clear with what I like and what I don't. 

I faced a fork between a compromise and determination: the university was not like the place that I imagined. I thought I could only learn the things that I wanted to learn, which was mainly computer science. But there was something called 'Common Core subjects', which is a kind of a system where freshmen or sophomores have to learn something that does not belong to the stream of their majors. 

Well, some people might think this is a great opportunity for students to have a broader knowledge, understanding and experience. For me, it was not. I did not plan to become a marketor, so I hated MKTG2411 or whatever it was named. I did not plan to become an Asian/Sino state of affairs expert, so I hated some subject that I discarded the information about the name of the subject of. 

All of these I thought were wasting my time. So I just did not like them. In contrast, I just got a really deep dive into the world of programming and development. I got up all night to code and program. The process of learning and exploring was so sweet for me. I bought additional books about programming to read. I joined sort of a... coding club. I made friends with coders. It was just so beautiful. And so I got B's and C's for subjects like... something on Hong Kong law or.. China's economy in the world. I just did not try to study them at my best. They were just obstacles to my way. 

In that course of self-exploration, I got to know that I am mainly intersted in web development. And I dug it more. I dug `React`, I dug `Sass`, I dug Material Design, I dug `ES6` and many more. 

It was so good. Programming was definite and logical. Nothing was like a metaphor in programming. If an input produced A from a function, it never produced B. Relation (in mathematics) was cool. It was what I wanted--exactly opposite from something like metaphor. A metaphor in literature could be interpreted in any ways depending on the person or the context or anything and it is meant to be like that. And that is not like function, so I did not like that.  

Oh, and plus, I liked reading books. But they were largely two types of books that I liked. Christian and programming. Other books like, like.. anything else, I did not read at all. 

### 3. At the Navy: most unexpected and drastic change in my life. 
So this is a long story.

Ok. First of all, as a Korean national, I had to enlist to serve for about two years. But I did not want to just waste that time in the army. I wanted to do something meaningful for my future career and my life. 

So I thought I could do something about computer science that is my major. And I found some positions related to it were available in the air force and the navy as well. So I made an application for both of them (actually I did for the army as well but that was not my real interest, as no 'professional' position that allow me to dive deep into computers was not really available).

And in the process of searching more information on the internet, I got to know that the navy would allow me to do something more professional than the air force. The navy allowed some of applicants like myself to enlist as a special position -- information systems technician. And I even had an interview for that at the ROKN HQ. In contrast, if I were to go for the air force, nothing really professional was fully guaranteed. I liked that offer from the navy very much. The interviewers said I would either go for a position on information security or program development. Both were fine for me. So after a long time of discussion with my family members and thinking about it on my own, I decided to enlist in the navy. And I did not know I was perhaps not going really the right way.  

Everything seemed to be going well until I was in the bootcamp. I hoped to go to the Navy HQ, but it was arranged randomly that I would go to the 1st Fleet Command. Well, that was fully understandable. I thought chances for program developments and cybersecurity would also be there.

And before the deployment to the 1st Fleet, I was handed over the list of vacancies in the 1st Fleet Command. And there were no positions about program developments and cybersecurity AT ALL.
