## Before starting to read this
People change. And so do I. This is a record of how I, as a programmer and social animal, changed over a course of time. 

## Who I was

### 1. Logical
Going back to middle and high school, I was a person of logical (+cynical, cold) personality. I tried to be as logical as possible for no clear reason for any decisions or human interactions such as conversations with my friends. 

I don't know exactly why I started to become like this. I don't remember when I started to have this personality. But when I looked into myself at some point, I became such a person. 

But I got along pretty well with those who were around myself. I saw things were going well, and I could do collaborative homework well too. 

I yet lacked an emotional or sensitive response from circumstances where I needed it. For example, when I was studying literature in either Korean or English, I could not express my feelings, or even feel that feelings well. I did not know what I was really writing when I was taking an exam on evaluating a poem or an essay. Because of that, sometimes I got a high grade for no clear reason that I don't even know, but many more times I got lower grades for the exam. And so I hated reading poems or novels. I could not understand why those things even existed in this world!  

### 2. I did not like indefinite, unclear subjects. 
Back to the poems, novel and essays -- they were not definite things. The interpretation of poems or novels could be A or B any time depending on contexts. If somebody thought the meaning of a title of some poem were 'life and death' because of some reason, that could be perfectly valid, while at the same time somebody would think otherwise for another valid reason. They were just not 'immutable' (to explain in a programmatic jargon). They were dynamic. Yeah. I did not like the things that were not constant on different contexts.   

### 3. Did not really put myself in other people's shoes
I said I was logical, but ironically I was short on this. I did not really understand, or tried to understand what people thought and why they behaved in such and such ways. 

Reflecting back to this time, this was partly because I did not experience enough. I had no really big troubles in my life. I did not have a cousin that I loved who died when I was 13. I did not have financial problems. I ate well, grew well, slept well. So to speak, I was too... uh.. 'clean'.  

### 4. Straight and plain talk
And I liked to talk straight and plain, without caring enough about how the listeners would feel and think about that. And I did not even know some people who had different personalities than I did were getting hurt from the words I spoke. 

But because I did not have an active emotion, I could not comfort somebody suitably.. or.. more exactly, I did not know how to comfort anybody. Liking to talk straight and plainly and talking to a friend to comfort him or her were completely different things. When a friend of mine would go through a bad, unwilling event, I could not really comfort him or her with some appropriate words. 

## Growing pains

### 1. At the university
I met a range of more diverse people at the university. This was a place where I could learn a lot, really a lot.

### 2. At the army

## Acquirements

### 1. Passion

### 2. And programming

### 3. Ability to understand others
