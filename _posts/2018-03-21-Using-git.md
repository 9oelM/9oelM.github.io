### [How to revert](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/)
```
git revert <SHA>
```
git revert will create a new commit that’s the opposite (or inverse) of the given SHA. If the old commit is “matter”, the new commit is “anti-matter”—anything removed in the old commit will be added in the new commit and anything added in the old commit will be removed in the new commit.
