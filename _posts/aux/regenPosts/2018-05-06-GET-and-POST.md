### What they have in common
They are all used to send an HTTP request to the server.

### GET
> The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. **Requests using GET should only retrieve data.**

### POST
> A POST request is typically sent via an HTML form and results in a change on the server.

Unlike `GET`, `POST` has a body in its request.
