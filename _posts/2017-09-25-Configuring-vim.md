Well, I just looked at [this repository](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and it just looks amazing. 

I cloned the repo to my local computer and installed the configuration.

For your information, the vim configurations are stored in `~/.vimrc` and `~/.vim_runtime` (if you installed the configurations from that repository).

`~/.viminfo` acts as a cache/history for vim.
