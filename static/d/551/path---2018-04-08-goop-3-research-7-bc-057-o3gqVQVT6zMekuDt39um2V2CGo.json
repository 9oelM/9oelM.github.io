First, you should find logos of other companies in the same/similar area of business (worldwide) — as many as you can. This is your first (market) research.</h3>\n<p>Ok. here we go. I just researched businesses not necessarily in the exactly the ‘same’ area (group communication), but rather tried to include wider breadth of businesses/apps in areas like group work, student-problem-solving tools, collaborative tools, messaging, human to human interactions, decision making/search tools, discussion boards, debates and so on):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://7oel.weebly.com/uploads/9/5/6/3/95631532/logosinthisfieldartboard-1_orig.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n<h3>2. Sometimes a company name contains nouns that you can easily visualize. Find as many logos as possible with them.</h3>\n<p>Ok. Now I need to pick up on some keywords (nouns / verbs / adjectives) and get some inspirations from existing designs with those keywords. Ok. here are some keywords ( + emotional invocations Jeff wanted to have on customers) that I could think of from GOOP. Then, I basically scrapped them all into one artboard. So Im kinda making a mood board. Bear in mind that this is not only an emotional thing, but also im looking into things like techniques and colors used. The bold impressions are the ones Jeff and Peter emphasized. Other ones are to be ‘additional’ only.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fun</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Easy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Smart</strong></li>\n<li>Friends</li>\n<li>Social</li>\n<li>Bright</li>\n<li>Friendly</li>\n<li>Active</li>\n<li>Young</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://7oel.weebly.com/uploads/9/5/6/3/95631532/inspirationsfromwords_orig.png\" alt=\"2\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GOOP: 3.
