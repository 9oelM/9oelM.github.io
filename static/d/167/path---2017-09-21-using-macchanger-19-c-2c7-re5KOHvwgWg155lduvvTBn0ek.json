You need to figure it out yourself). <code class=\"language-text\">eth0</code> is the ethernet (wired)interface, and <code class=\"language-text\">wlan0</code> is wireless LAN interface. </p>\n<p>So if you are using a wired connection, you need to care about <code class=\"language-text\">eth0</code>. You need to care about <code class=\"language-text\">wlan0</code> if you are using a wireless connection. </p>\n<p>If you are still worried, just change mac addresses of both interfaces. </p>\n<p>Then you get your network interface turned off, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># ifconfig wlan0 down</code></pre></div>\n<p>You are going to see that your wireless(or wired) connection is gone on your taskbar, for example. If you are still unsure, check by using <code class=\"language-text\">ifconfig</code> again, and the interface you turned off won’t be shown anymore. </p>\n<p>and use macchanger to generate a new mac address (there are many options. Just do <code class=\"language-text\">macchanger -h</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">man macchanger</code> to check it out):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># macchanger -r wlan0\nmacchanger -r wlan0\nCurrent MAC:   12:34:56:78:90:ab (The name of your vendor)\nPermanent MAC: 12:34:56:78:90:ab (The name of your vendor)     \nNew MAC:       34:a1:f3:ds:12:39 (unknown)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now turn the interface on again:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># ifconfig wlan0 up</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now there you go. Your mac address is temporarily changed.</p>\n<h2>One problem I faced</h2>\n<p>Everything went well, but I needed to restart my wifi even after <code class=\"language-text\">ifconfig wlan0 up</code> because the connection was not established. <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/586269/spoofed-mac-address-changes-when-trying-to-connect-to-network\">I searched on the web and found an answer to this.</a></p>\n<p>This solution works perfectly for me:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo service network-manager stop\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\nsudo service network-manager start</code></pre></div>\n<p>This way, you do not have to manually restart wifi after <code class=\"language-text\">ifconfig wlan0 up</code>. </p>\n<h2>Warning</h2>\n<p>The fake mac address will be reset to the original mac address if you choose to connect to another wifi or restart the interface. Now, there is a solution to spoof the mac address every time the machine wakes up. </p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://mr-polite.github.io/hacking/2017/09/21/changing-mac-address-semi-permanently.html\">spoofing the mac address semi-permanently</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using macchanger","date":"September 21, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-09-21--using-macchanger/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-09-21--changing-mac-address-semi-permanently/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Changing mac address semi permanently"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-09-21--finding-a-process-with-a-name/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finding a process with a name"}}}}
