You can see my related posts on that. </p>\n<p>I had to go to the military after providing the design and the website for Goop. So I could no longer work for Goop after like 2017 June. That was it. A job only for a month. And now I became curious on how Goop’s doing, so I checked on them.</p>\n<h2>Present</h2>\n<p>As of now, GOOP has been pretty successful!\nGOOP has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>penetrated more than 1/3 of the population in HKU</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goop-where-good-friends-stay/id1260299914?ls=1&#x26;mt=8\">been downloaded 10K+ times on Google Play</a>. Stats not shown on App Store. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/goop4groups/?ref=goop\">got 1K+ likes on Facebook</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yeah, true that. I have only contributed at the beginning for the logo, design, and landing page, but it was really a worthwhile experience, looking back—especially because Goop has made such a success now. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GOOP: 7.
