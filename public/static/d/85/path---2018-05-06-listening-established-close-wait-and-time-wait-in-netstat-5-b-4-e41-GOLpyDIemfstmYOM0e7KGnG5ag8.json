Packets may arrive out of order or be retransmitted after the connection has been closed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>CLOSE_WAIT</strong> indicates that the remote endpoint (other side of the connection) has closed the connection. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TIME_WAIT</strong> indicates that local endpoint (this side) has closed the connection. The connection is being kept around so that any delayed packets can be matched to the connection and handled appropriately. The connections will be removed when they time out within four minutes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/netstat\">The man page of <code class=\"language-text\">netstat</code></a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">   ESTABLISHED\n          The socket has an established connection.\n   SYN_SENT\n          The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.\n   SYN_RECV\n          A connection request has been received from the network.\n   FIN_WAIT1\n          The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down.\n   FIN_WAIT2\n          Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for  a  shutdown\n          from the remote end.\n   TIME_WAIT\n          The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the\n          network.\n   CLOSE  The socket is not being used.\n   CLOSE_WAIT\n          The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.\n   LAST_ACK\n          The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed.
