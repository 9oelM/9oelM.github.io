Each short summary always refers back to the relevant page number in the book. The post ends with my personal reflection. Some may ask why the summary should be so long, while you could just go and read the book again. Well, the book itself quite lengthy and contains lots of atomic logics, and the summary is still short compared to the book. The point of making a summary for myself personally is to quickly get back anytime to here and find the part in the book that was or became meaningful to me.

(vii)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Answer: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we <em>quickly become slaves to our passions - and there’s nothing freeing about that.</em> (viii)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most people don’t like rules. But they live in a chaos, and they don’t like themselves being in a chaos too. That’s the reason they would need a set of rules to live against.</p>\n<p>Short introduction to Jordan as an ‘erudite’, ‘practical’, renowned, and knowledgeable person. (~xiv)</p>\n<p>Jordan’s first book <em>Maps of Meaning</em> explains why and how we do things that we do today, to deal with uncertainty and the unavoidable unknown. It contains somewhat more complex concepts, which <em>12 Rules of Life</em> actually based upon. (~xv)</p>\n<p>Young people actually have an hunger for rules. They’ve been taught two contradicting ideas at schools, which left them just confused on what’s right or wrong (xx). One major school of thought is that “morality is relative, at best a personal ‘value judgement’.” There is no absolute right or wrong in anything. Even more extreme: postmodernist left’s argument that a group’s morality is nothing but its attempt to exercise power over another group (xxii). Therefore, the best way to live, is to simply tolerate and respect different ways of living a life. But it turns out that <strong>people in moral relativism can’t live without a moral compass</strong> (~xxiii).</p>\n<p>While modern response to different rules of different societies was relativism, nihilism or ideology, the ancient Greeks endevoured to search for the reasons and ideas intertwined with those rules. Aristotle found one striking similarity across these societies too: while the rules differed, human beings have a tendency to make rules, laws and customs.

Just functions in the same mechanism as alcohol addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuation of these bad habits or psychological state will only lead to itself again!</strong> (-26)</p>\n<h3 id=\"rising-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Rising Up<a href=\"#rising-up\" aria-label=\"rising up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8c3bac8282b061e2546d8642a7cb94f7/627f4/1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 177.7027027027027%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"1\"\n        title=\"1\"\n        src=\"/static/8c3bac8282b061e2546d8642a7cb94f7/1c72d/1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8c3bac8282b061e2546d8642a7cb94f7/a80bd/1.jpg 148w,\n/static/8c3bac8282b061e2546d8642a7cb94f7/1c91a/1.jpg 295w,\n/static/8c3bac8282b061e2546d8642a7cb94f7/1c72d/1.jpg 590w,\n/static/8c3bac8282b061e2546d8642a7cb94f7/627f4/1.jpg 810w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Stop being in a defeated posture (30)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe you are a loser.

If you make a habit (or in the context of this book, a <em>rule</em> in your life), it is rather going to free you. For example, if you make a habit to save money, it will going to give you more freedom in buying stuffs later when you need them, while on the surface it might seem like that habit is restricting you from buying anything.</p>\n<p>Isn’t it so ironic? Mere freedom doesn’t grant you freedom. It curbs you instead.</p>\n<p>The connection lies in <em>Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)</em>. Almost all expediency comes at a cost and is not necessary.

Specifically, Rule 5 entails the reason to be one. Although the title reads <em>Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them</em>, JP’s point is right on the fact that all children will become adults some day. Therefore, if children are not disciplined and not trained to be social and responsible to live along with others, they are not going to be a good adult when they grow up. That’s JP’s insistence with which I agree.</p>\n<p>If you search ‘grow the hell up’ on Google, one of the first things you will probably see is Jordan Peterson’s lecture, or his tweet, or something from him anyway.</p>\n<p>I like this wording very much: grow the hell up. Yes, everyone needs to grow the hell up.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about how I behave throughout the day, if someone were monitoring me 24/7 and I didn’t know that (like God), then I would feel 200% embarrassed for what I have been doing.</p>\n<p>Too many parts of my life are still so childish. Can’t control myself. No disciplines, no rules. Sometimes just doing what I want for fun, for expediency. For immediate happiness.</p>\n<p>So that line really touched me because I really need to grow the hell up. Otherwise, what’s so different between myself and a child apart from the uselessly gigantic magnitude of my body.</p>\n<p>An adult is an adult. An adult who doesn’t want to take responsibilties - <em>not</em> wanting to do the dishes, do exercises, pay the bill, take a shower, brush teeth, empty the trash can, do laundry, make a living, give presents to friends, visit parents once in a while - is just a child. It’s just doing what others always do. Easy.</p>\n<p>In the times of Covid, especially when I am just stuck at home, no one’s watching me other than myself, so I am quite programmed to sit in front of my laptop and do useless stuffs like surfing on the web, which is obviously not quite the definition of a grown-up adult. This isn’t what I should do and I’ve got a clear aim for the year (undisclosed).</p>\n<h3 id=\"confidence\" style=\"position:relative;\">Confidence<a href=\"#confidence\" aria-label=\"confidence permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Being stooped doesn’t help. This is what JP mentioned in the first chapter: <em>Stand up straight with your shoulders back</em>.</p>\n<p>I still remember my stooped, or crooked posture during my high school years. Now that I think back, there were reasons for it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My backpack was way too heavy, which my made my shoulders rounded, and overall posture stooped. Due to the stupid fear that I would leave something behind in my school locker when I would need it home, I just decided to carry everything in my bag. And that was the time iPad didn’t exist yet, and still lots of academic materials were in an actual materialistic form. Anyway, due to some naive decision I decided to carry everything in my bag, and so I even got myself a very hard and strong bag: a <a href=\"https://www.swissgear.com/\">Swissgear</a> one. That allowed me to carry even heavier things with me, which then contributed to stooping my neck and shoulders even more.</li>\n<li>The high school was a time of difficulties. I could barely sleep and almost always could not have breakfast due to overwhelming amount of assignments and homework. I think I wanted to be compensated somehow by being recognized of my difficulty, and represented that desire by having that stupid posture, implying something like: “hey man, I’m out of my energy. Guess what made me like this”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, stupid reasons. But I fixed that right after graduating, or in the middle of my high school years - I don’t quite remember clearly. But now I’m standing up straight with my shoulders back. The only problem is that my occupation is somewhat prone to rounded shoulders (haha).</p>\n<p>This also leads to the topic of confidence (sometimes blatancy, too). Why not get confident instead of denouncing or disbeliving yourself. Even if you fail later, there’s a bad reason not to get confident about yourself.</p>\n<p>Everyone enters the world of chaos every moment. That often leads the way down to being unconfident. You’re doing some project at work and someone quits his job and you’re lost. You’ve filed an application for higher education and unsure about the upcoming result. You’ve launched a business and unconfident if things will work out. All of these things. But when you think about it, there’s really no reason to be unconfident. Of course, being critical and being unconfident are differnt and you already know why. Being critical is OK and will help. But unconfident? why? Even confidence with no reason may be better than unconfidence sometimes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"good-friends\" style=\"position:relative;\">Good friends<a href=\"#good-friends\" aria-label=\"good friends permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I feel grateful for having my present friends. They’re all motivated, successful individuals. They know how to enjoy, challenge, endeavor, and sometimes chill. We sometimes help each other, talk through some problem, or hang out together. They are certainly not of the type that I wouldn’t want my family members or another friend to be friends with, which is coherent with <em>Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comparison-and-self-esteem\" style=\"position:relative;\">Comparison and self-esteem<a href=\"#comparison-and-self-esteem\" aria-label=\"comparison and self esteem permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>From some of the casual chats with my friends, I noticed that some of them are comparatively more subject to comparing themselves with others. And this is an evident problem for me too, but under my unconsciousness, I kind of try to become oblivious to this because of the fear that merely noticing it might hurt my self-esteem.</p>\n<p>There are millions of developers who are more skillful and able than me. I’m also now ‘stuck’ between employment and education because I now need to go back to school and finish my degree, which will take at least 1.5 years for which I am not sure if I will be able to work. My friends and other successful individuals I get to look at on Linkedin are all off schools and at work, seemingly commencing a good career path. That actually makes me not want to go onto Linkedin too often. Many job offers are knocking on the door weekly but I can’t simply accept them for now, unless they are part time or full time promised for some distant future. I feel like I’m <em>late</em> compared to others. But <em>Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.</em> To iterate the core of JP’s argument just once more: there is no point comparing others with you. What’s even being <em>late</em>? There’s no <em>late</em>. Already, <em>late</em> can be justified when there’s someone else to be compared with.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I decided not to slip into the swamp of dismal comparisons anymore. My goal is mine, and my life is mine. Can’t be compared with others’.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"12 Rules for Life: a detailed summary and reflection of a truly life-changing book (11 / 100)","date":"February 17, 2022","keywords":["12 Rules for life","detail","summary","reflection","jordan peterson"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2022-02-17--detailed-summary-and-reflection-of-12-rules-for-life-a-truly-life-changing-piece/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022-02-02-100BooksProject-(10):Cosmos/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"100BooksProject: (10): Cosmos","tab":"post","tags":["books","cosmos"],"keywords":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022-02-20-평균의-종말-완전-요약-및-감상평/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"<평균의 종말> 완전 요약 및 감상평 (12 / 100)","tab":"post","tags":["books"],"keywords":["평균의 종말","책","독후감","감상평","요약"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","426816048"]}
