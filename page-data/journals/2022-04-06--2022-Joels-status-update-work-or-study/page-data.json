I had to, otherwise I would have to drop from the uni in accordance with <a href=\"https://www.hku.hk/\">HKU</a>’s regulation, where it is stated that students must complete the degree in 8 years in maximum (+2 for Korean males, for military service)</p>\n<p>Now I’ve just hit a month since I started school again, and the graduation will come in May 2023.

It will come. But not now. It’s been a few months since I stopped working, and I already feel bored with the academics. I don’t feel like the graduation will ever come.</p>\n<p>I mean, TBH, the only three things that are holding me off in the academics are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>College degree</li>\n<li>The possibility of proceeding to the postgraduate study</li>\n<li>Some ‘useful’ courses</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the college degree will come out anyway regardless of my cGPA, unless I really spoil it, and I believe I haven’t gotten anywhere near there yet. So I’m in my safe zone in terms of the grades. </p>\n<p>No. 2 - the postgraduate study - although I have put it in the list, it’s vague and not likely. I don’t feel like I am a person who really gets excited about papers and research. I’m more of a learner in practical matters. And my cGPA looks hopeless if I were to file an application for prestigious universities for postgrad (at least now).  </p>\n<p>Lastly, there are some relevant, useful courses. I mean, who can’t say every course is relevant to everyone? There must be something that has to do with me. There are some few courses that would be inevitable to take for the next big steps, like linear algebra or calculus, which will help understand ML better. But some courses like ‘Project Management’, and ‘Principles of management’, … sigh. I’ve learned them already very, very practically at work for more than two years.</p>\n<p>But apart from that, no particular courses seem to be very compelling to take right now. There are tonnes of MOOCs of the same topic I can take (I’ve taken some already based on my needs) on the Internet. Otherwise, those skills, for example, multithreaded programming, can just be learned in a practical manner: just by doing it. <a href=\"https://github.com/9oelM/elasticpwn\">I have successfully created a multithreaded CLI in Go</a> without learning it by taking a lecture at uni (I mean, of course, right?).</p>\n<p>Yeah, I even considered dropping from the uni, but I ain’t a freshman. I already finished the first two years. And some other personal factors counted in. So I put a pause on that thought and decided not to drop in the end.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-good-about-working\" style=\"position:relative;\">What’s good about working?<a href=\"#whats-good-about-working\" aria-label=\"whats good about working permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Well, most importantly: it’s much of fun, right? At least it’s not boring. I get to code and talk with people, which I don’t when I study ‘Linear Algebra I’ or ‘Calculus and Vector Analysis (I)‘.</p>\n<p>And, I would be able to financially support myself too. I’m currently just using what I’ve earned over the last two years. It is not going to get deplete, but I just don’t feel quite comfortable about spending with no income, as anyone would.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-bad-about-working\" style=\"position:relative;\">What’s bad about working?<a href=\"#whats-bad-about-working\" aria-label=\"whats bad about working permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Well. Just the fact that you are studying (to the minimum extent) and working at the same time means you gotta manage yourself really well. If I am studying to the minimum extent, I am also now regarding the college education just as a means to get a college degree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-i-might-be-able-to-work-right\" style=\"position:relative;\">So I might be able to work, right?<a href=\"#so-i-might-be-able-to-work-right\" aria-label=\"so i might be able to work right permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>So I’ve been receiving lots of offers but haven’t been able to give positive replies because I have been in such a weird circumstance, stuck somewhere between work and uni.</p>\n<p>But I am still hesitating to the last moment. Would it be really worth it to put studying back on the shelf and take more time on a full-time job. Or should I just wait until May 2023 and keep studying a bit like a nerd, which is a year after. But after all, work sounds more exciting.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there are multiple roles that I am confident about: web fullstack developer, javascript specialist (if there is one), or automation engineer. And you will know why once you skim through my blog, visit my Github or look at my Linkedin.</p>\n<p>Please let me know(hj923 [at] hotmail [dot] com) if you have good deals. Typically, a ‘good deal’ would qualify as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A salary of +100K USD / year</li>\n<li>Work is fully remote (it <em>must</em> be; because I might need to move across countries for the undergrad study)</li>\n<li>Work is entirely based on English communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking forward to receive inbounds then.
