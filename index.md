# Hey, it's me, Joel. 

# Contact
* `hj923@hotmail.com` (I'm seldom able to check email for these days in the military, though.)
* Search on Facebook: `Joel Mun`.
* Or, better, [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/7oelm/). I frequently go on Linkedin. 

## I'm tooooooooo lazy to add polished contents on this main page. So bear with this bare design. Here's my brief introduction: 

* **Born** in 1997
* **Speaks** fluent English and Korean, and conversational Chinese
* **Lived** in China for about 6 years, in Hong Kong for about 2 years, in Korea for the rest.
* **Studies** in the University of Hong Kong. 
* **Serves** currently in the Republic of Korea Navy, until August, 2019: _meaning, eagerly looking for a job to work for after that time of discharge._ 
* **Loves** exploring and learning new technologies in web development, especially those relevant to front-end.
