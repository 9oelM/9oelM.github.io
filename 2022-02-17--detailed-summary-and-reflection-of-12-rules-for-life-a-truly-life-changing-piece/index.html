<p>This post is a very detailed summary and reflection of <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/about/">Jordan Peterson</a>’s book: <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021">12 Rules for Life</a></em>. Each short summary always refers back to the relevant page number in the book. The post ends with my personal reflection. Some may ask why the summary should be so long, while you could just go and read the book again. Well, the book itself quite lengthy and contains lots of atomic logics, and the summary is still short compared to the book. The point of making a summary for myself personally is to quickly get back anytime to here and find the part in the book that was or became meaningful to me. Oh, and sorry about the typos ahead that even I don’t know they exist due to the length of this post. Please let me know if you find one.</p>

<ul>
<li>Question: Why even expect more rules in our lives anyways, while it seems pretty clear that people don’t like rules? (vii)</li>
<li>
<p>Answer: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we <em>quickly become slaves to our passions - and there’s nothing freeing about that.</em> (viii)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people don’t like rules. But they live in a chaos, and they don’t like themselves being in a chaos too. That’s the reason they would need a set of rules to live against.</p>
<p>Short introduction to Jordan as an ‘erudite’, ‘practical’, renowned, and knowledgeable person. (~xiv)</p>
<p>Jordan’s first book <em>Maps of Meaning</em> explains why and how we do things that we do today, to deal with uncertainty and the unavoidable unknown. It contains somewhat more complex concepts, which <em>12 Rules of Life</em> actually based upon. (~xv)</p>
<p>Young people actually have an hunger for rules. They’ve been taught two contradicting ideas at schools, which left them just confused on what’s right or wrong (xx). One major school of thought is that “morality is relative, at best a personal ‘value judgement’.” There is no absolute right or wrong in anything. Even more extreme: postmodernist left’s argument that a group’s morality is nothing but its attempt to exercise power over another group (xxii). Therefore, the best way to live, is to simply tolerate and respect different ways of living a life. But it turns out that <strong>people in moral relativism can’t live without a moral compass</strong> (~xxiii).</p>
<p>While modern response to different rules of different societies was relativism, nihilism or ideology, the ancient Greeks endevoured to search for the reasons and ideas intertwined with those rules. Aristotle found one striking similarity across these societies too: while the rules differed, human beings have a tendency to make rules, laws and customs. (~xxv)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that all human beings are, by some kind of biological endowment, so ineradicably concenred with morality that we create a structure of laws and rules wherever we are. <strong>The idea that human life can be free of moral concerns is a fantasy.</strong> (xxv)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are rule generators. And given that we are moral animals, what must be the effectt of our simplistic modern relativism upon us? It means that <strong>we are hobbling ourselves by pretending to be something we are not.</strong> (xxv)</p>

<p>Jordan first started to answer some questions about ilfe on Quora, and started to get some popularity there. In 2013, he started to upload videos of his lectures at university, which got popular too. (~xxx)</p>
<p>Later he was suggested to write a guide on ‘how to live well’, and the proposal was acceptede by Penguin Random House. (~xxxviii)</p>
<p>The title was picked as so because it’s clear that we need rules. We need order. But chaos exists too, which hinder us from being in an order. </p>

<p>If we each live properly, we will collectively flourish. (xxxix)</p>

<p>Lobsters have a simple nervous systems which could be thoroughly studied by scientists (1). This helps us understand how our brain and behavior function too.</p>

<p>Wrens would warn and fight you when you get into their territory. Both wrens and lobsters are obsessed with status and position.</p>
<p>Also important for chickens too: the location (proximity to prey) of chicken determines its priority in getting the food, thus the survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wiliest, strongest, healthiest and most fortunate birds occupy prime territory, and defend it. Because of this, they are more likely to attract high-quality mates, and to hatch chcisk who survive and thrive. (4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pandemic across birds would kill the least dominant and the most vulnerable birds first. Same for human societies. </p>
<p>Territorial conflict imposes a problem: how to win or lose without the disagreeing parties incurring too great a cost (because the winner might be hurt even after winning, which means the 3rd bird can come in and take the space). (4)</p>

<p>A defated wolf shows its subordination to a victor by a specific gesture. Dolphins make certain sounds to reduce conflict between dominant and subordinate group members. Many other animals behave like so. (5)</p>
<p>Lobsters too. They want a safe place to hide. The place may be scarce. When two lobsters competing for the same spot encounter each other, they spout chemicals containing information of size, sex, health, and mood out to each other. (6) If a lobster finds that the opponent is too big, it will just retreat.</p>
<p>Otherwise, lobsters will try to flip the other on its back. Once they do it, the flipped one will generally give up and leave. </p>
<p>Otherwise, they will physically fight. Typically, they will have a winner here. The once dominant brain will phyiscally replace itself with a subordinate brain. (8)</p>
<p>Victors will have high serotonin and low octopamine, and losers the reverse. (8-9)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Winner lobster) … is a coky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less liekly to back down when challenged. … (the loser lobster is) … a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners … (8-9)</p>

<p>Nature is not a simple thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is dynamic: as the environment changes, the faetures that make a given individual successful in surviving and reproducing also transform and change. So natural selection is not “creatures matching themselves ever more precisely to a template specified by the world”, but a very interactive process between the nature and the world.</li>
<li>It is static: some things change less quickly. “Leaves change more quickly than trees, and trees more quickly than forests.” (15)</li>
</ul>
<p>There exists an ancient and fundamental part in our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy: the reason we act like lobsters when we are defeated. Weak people exhibit low levels of serotoin, thus much of stress and vulnerability to illness, death and depression. (18)</p>

<p>If you are at the top, you get all of the best parts: good counterpart, health, opportunities, … If you are at the botttom, you don’t get anything. Terrible food, nowhere to live, poor mental and physical conditions, etc. We are not talking about possessing money here; it’s just about a general human life (18-19)</p>
<p>‘The ancient part of the brain’ will watch how other people treat you. If they treat you badly, it will incur low serotonin level. This process burns up a lot of energy. It’s called <strong>stress</strong>. (19)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It ‘s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. (19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are already stressed, even the smallest external stimuli will cause chains of negative reactions in your mental and physical state, making you de-energized, impulsive, etc.</p>
<p>If you are at the top (not stressed), you already know you are safe and all good, so chances of you being damanged from a threat is substantially low. <strong>The result is that you still stay clam, tall, straight, and confident</strong>. (20)</p>

<p>Inconsistent patterns of sleeping and eating can cause a stress too. The body needs to “function like a well-rehearsed orchestra”</p>
<p><strong>Your sleeping and eating schedule need to be consistent in order to keep you out of chaos!</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is for such reasons that I always ask my clinical clients first about sleep. … If the answer is no, fixing thatt is the first thing I recommend.</p>
<p>The next thing I ask about is breakfast. … eat a fat and protein-heavy breakfastt as soon as possible after they are awaken.</p>

<p>Having a fat, protein-heavy breakfast ASAP will prevent you from having a high insulin level that will make you psychologically unstable. (20-21)</p>

<li>You feel vulnerable</li>
<li>You do something bad in order to fix that</li>
<li>You feel better</li>
<li>Some time later, you feel vulnerable because of something bad you did in order to fix it</li>
<li>Then you do something bad again</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: <strong>alcohol addiction</strong>. A person drinks an alcohol. Makes him happy. When he stops drinking, he will feed bad due to metabolization and secretion of toxins. To remove that bad feeling, he will just resume drinking. After that, the hungover goes on again, and then it can be temporarily handled with a few more drinks. It will go on and on.</p>
<p>Another example: agoraphobia or experience of being bullied. Just functions in the same mechanism as alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>Stop being in a defeated posture (30)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you are a loser. And maybe you are not - but if you are, you don’t have to continue in that mode. Maybe you just have a bad habit. Maybe you’re even just a collection of bnad habits. Nonetheless, even if you came by your poor posture honestly - even if you were unpopular or bullied at home or in grade school - it’s not necessarily appropriate now. Circumstances change. <strong>If you slump around, with the same bearing that characterizes a defeated lobster, people will assign you are lower status, and the old counter that you share with crustaceans, sitting at the very base of your brain, will assign you a low dominance number.</strong> (30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standing up straight with shoulders back has not only physical but also psychological implications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Circumstances change, and so can you.  … if you present yourself as defeated, then people will react to you as if you are losing. If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently. … But <strong>standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only phyiscal, because you;re not only a body. You’re a spirit, so to speak - a psyche - as well.</strong>  (31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life is terrible, but standing up straight with shoulders back means confidently accepting that and trying to improve it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To stand up … is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, … means deciding to boluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. … means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, … </p>
<p><strong>So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around.</strong> (32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, people will start to perceive you as a dominant being. Why not try it first and see how it goes before even going into defeated mode? (33)</p>

<li>So far, it’s been explained why <strong>chaos and order</strong> are two most fundamental elements of lived experience (Being). Chaos and order are perceived as <strong>personalities</strong> as well. (43-44)</li>
<li>Perception of things as entities with personality occurs before perception of things as things. This works the same for order and chaos. They are personified first, and then perceived as things and objects. (44)</li>
<li>Therefore, the most significant elements of our environment of origin were peronsalities, not things, objects or situations. (44)</li>
<li>The personalities majorly have been split into <strong>male</strong> and <strong>female</strong> for a billion years, since when there has been separate sexes (44).</li>
<li>Naturally, the category of <strong>parent</strong> and <strong>child</strong> has existed for a long time too, unavoidably deeply embedded into our psychology (44)</li>
<li>We are social and we care about other creatures, which can be translated as environment. (45)</li>
<li>Our brain also has a capacity to have knowledge about the nature of the world, or the objective world. We grew to <strong>deal with</strong> what’s <strong>outside</strong> of what we currently understand. (45)</li>
<li>

<p>Many religious symbols share masculinity and feminity at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Star of David</li>
<li>the yoni and lingam of Hinduism</li>
<li>Fuxi and Nuwa in China</li>
<li>the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child</li>
<li>androgyny of Christ</li>

</li>

<p>The structure of the brain also reflects this duality (48): </p>

<p>the hemispheric structure of the cortex reflects the fundamental division between novelty (the unknown, or chaos) and routinization (the known, order)</p>

</li>
<li>We all know this, but we don’t know we know it. <strong>We eternally inhabit order, surroundded by chaos.</strong> (49) (This sentence is what really sums up the last few pages)</li>
<li>Chaos and order is anywhere in our lives, and the balance between chaos and order is crucial. Being inclined on either side too much may cause a problem. Neither shouldn’t exist too. The same applies for other living things (50-51)</li>

<p>As previously mentioned, Genesis was combined from multiple sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: ‘Priestly’ story (refer back to 38)</li>
<li>Naturally connects to Chapter 2, suggesting someone or some people carefully attached these two stories together</li>
<li>Chapter 2: ‘Jahwist’ story (52)</li>
<li>Uses the name YHWH (Jahweh) to describe God</li>
<li>Contains the story of Adam and Eve</li>
<li>Adam was instructed not to touch or eat the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, but he did</li>
<li>Adam and Eve were not self-conscious: they were naked but not ashamed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 3 has a serpent appearing. While <strong>God only knows why it’s inside the garden</strong>,<strong>the serpent appears to play the role of chaos, and the paradise that of order.</strong> (53)</li>
<li>Where there is an order, there has to be a chaos, <em>because nothing can be completely walled off from the rest of reality.</em> (54)</li>
<li>The absence of chaos would also be problematic: <em>how could the nature of man ever reach its full potential without challenge and danger?</em> (54)</li>
<li>Anyway, Eve eats the forbidden fruit, and becomes self-conscious. (55-56)</li>

<p> What does it mean to know yourself (and your partner) naked?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Naked means: vulnerable, easily damanged, subject to judgement for beauty and health, unprotected, unarmed. (57)</li>
<li>But that doesn’t mean we can justly resent or hate the Ideal: knowledgeable, accomplished mathematicians should not disappear just because of my poor math skills. (58)</li>
<li>God spots Adam and Eve being self-conscious, and punishes them with ‘having to work’ and pregnancy respectively, and they are expelled from Paradise, out into the unknown, chaotic world. (59-61)</li>
<li>Back to the original query (at 35): why would someone buy prescription medication for his dog, and carefully administer it, and not do the same for himself?</li>
<li>Answer: why should take care of anything as naked, ugly, ashamed, … as a descendant of Adam, even if that being is himself? Actually, you are the one who knows the most about yourself, your transgressions, insufficiencies and inadequacies. No one else has more reason to regard you as a pathetic man. <strong>And by witholding something that might do you good (the medication), you can punish yourself for all your failings. A harmless, innocent, unselfconscious dog is more deserving.</strong> (61) </li>

<li>Dogs and cats are predetors: they kill things and eat them. But we still own them as pets and give them meds when they’re sick. (62)</li>
<li>Why?: because they are predators by nature, without self-conscious. No comprehension of their weakness, vulnerability, pain, and death.</li>
<li>Humans?: they know. <strong>we know exactly how and where we can be hurt, and why.</strong> <em>This is as good a definition as any of self-consciousness.</em></li>
<li>We can do a lot with that: feel pain, disgust, shame, horror, terrify, humiliate, torture, … <strong>only man will inflict suffering for the sake of suffering.</strong> <em>That is the best definition of evil I have been able to formulate.</em> (63)</li>
<li>Man can make things worse voluntarily. This validates the idea of Original Sin: who could deny it with the sense of inbuilt corruption and capacity for wrongdoing? (63)</li>

<li>It might not simply be the self-consciousness that makes us doubt our own worth. Perhaps it is [instead] <strong>our unwillingness - reflected in Adam’s shamed hiding - to walk with God, despite our fragility and propensity for evil. (66)</strong></li>
<li>We don’t take care of ourselves because we know we are fallen creatures. (67)</li>
<li>2000 years ago, people were much more barbaric than any peoples in the world right now: arena sports, human (child) sacrifice, … And right now, aggressive people will just go to jail. Unacceptable. (67-68)</li>
<li>Widespread belief: people are arrogant and selfish.</li>
<li>
<p>But at the same time, they have exceeding amounts of self-disgust, self-contempt, shame and self-consciousness. <strong>This is the reason they don’t value themselves at all</strong> instead of caring of their own importance. Really, they are aware of their own faults and inadequacies, ashamed and doubtful of their own value. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>They believe that other people shouldn’t suffer, and they will work diligently and altruistically to help them alleviate it. They extend the same courtesy even to the animals they are acquainted with - but not so easily to themselves.</strong> (68)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Self-sacrifice is well presented by the Christ. But it does not mean to suffer more than what is offered in return. If so, it’s just a slave and a tyrant in a relationship.</li>
<li>Standing up and speaking for yourself and someone else have almost no difference, because anyone is stumbling, sinful and imperfect anyways. (69)</li>
<li>
<p>you don’t have a right to torture and mistreat yourself, because: </p>
<ul>
<li>God claims you don’t belong to yourself</li>
<li>Your Being affects others (i.e. suicide)</li>
<li>We have a spark of the divine in us which belongs to God</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People in fact have overwhelming, unexpected and miraculous ability to  overcome difficulties (i.e. those with severely sick conditions or close ones with the equivalent). It’s just amazing how all people go through troubles and make a way out of that all by themselves despite mortal vulnerability, tyranny of the state, and depredations of nature. (70-71)</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, <strong>humanity deserves some serious respect</strong>. Everyone deserves respect, and you also. (71)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. <strong>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</strong> … to treat yourself as if you were someone you are reponsible for helping is, instead, <strong>to consider what would be truly good for you.</strong> (72)</p>

</li>
<li>good vs happy: what makes you happy isn’t what’s good in most cases and we all know that (72)</li>
<li>always think about what would be good for me and the ways to achieve that. (72-73)</li>

<li>Parents neglect discplinary approaches for the fear of themselves not being liked or loved anymore, or for deliberate reasons. <strong>This is not good.</strong>(145)</li>
<li>If parents act like this, that means they want friendship with their children. Friends are very easy to ignore and have a limited authority  for discipline (145)</li>

<p>It is an act of responsibility to discpline a child. (146)</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s true that it’s difficult to discipline a child. But disregarding such a duty will produce irresponsible, helpless adults. Discipline also does not harm creativity. Children will keep trying to draw attentions by doing useless things from adults if not controlled (146-147)</li>
<li>Provocative, immature children will cause problems and even try to dominate their parents (147-148)</li>
<li>Children are just trying to scout the boundary of permissible behaviors in taking their provoking actions. It’s important to let them know the boundary once they do (148)</li>
<li>You really need to take practical actions to discipline your child. This does not make them dislike you either. Crying is often just a sign of their anger, which is fine to not be concerned about. (149-151)</li>

<li>Discipline and punish must be handled carefully but are definitely needed (153)</li>
<li>Emprical evidences from experiments on pigeons show that it’s possible to discipline with reward (153-154)</li>
<li>It’s also possible to discpline with negativity. We learn from bad emotions and pains, and will not repeat the action that caused them. (154-155)</li>
<li>The question is not how to protect children from failures, but to help them learn in a useful, supervised way. Overprotected children won’t just know how to deal with failures. (156-157)</li>
<li>A child with insufficient learning on sharing will fail to socialize with his peers. Lonely. Rejected. Anxiety, depression and resentment. (157)</li>
<li>Parents not disciplining their children will leave their children vulnerable to fear and pain when they grow up (157)</li>
<li>Reward and punishment should adequately be used to bring a child success and prevent failure in the world outside the family. The result otherwise is just a semi-grown adult (158-159)</li>

<p>Two general ”rules about rules’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t lay out too many rules for children (160-161)</li>
<li>Use the least force to enforce the rules (161)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the second rule: start from the weakest force and determine the appropriate degree of force. (162)</li>
<li>Children with wonderful politeness and discipline makes everyone smile and attracts compliments (162-163)</li>
<li>
<p>There are a variety of valid reasons for physical punishment: </p>
<ul>
<li>to stop worse things from happening because the alternative could be fatal. (163-164)</li>
<li>the word <em>no</em> must be effectively understood to another person without the threat of punishment, and that’s not the case for children. If you think about it, adults say <em>no</em> to a child because they are larger, stronger and more capable. (164-165)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of hitting a child (165):</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of ”hitting” is too broad. </li>
<li>Magnitude and context matter.</li>
<li>Even children know the difference between being bitten by a mean dog and being nipped by his own pet when he plays with it. (165)</li>
<li>If a child smacks her sister in head and gets flicked by her parents, she will build a connection between these two and remember that it is not a good behavior. Otherwise, a child grows up to be an irresponsible, impolite adult. (165-166)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It all boils down to discipline effectively or ineffectively (166)</li>
<li>A time out alone until a child calms down can be a good punishment (166)</li>
<li>Otherwise, test gradually with more force, and see which degree of force suits the child, even up to swatting over the backside (167)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not thinking such things through, then you’re not acting responsibly as a parent. <strong>You’re leaving the dirty work to someone else, who will be much dirtier doing it.</strong> (167)</p>

<li>The theme of delay of gratification is marked by sacrifice in the Bible (193)</li>
<li>We learned that regulation of impulses could bring rewards in the future (193)</li>
<li>It’s still very easy to forgo the benefits in the future and spend them right away now (194)</li>
<li>First question: what must be sacrified? Small ones, but larger ones bring greater impact in the future. (195)</li>
<li>Second question: what would be the largest, most effective - most pleasing - of all possible sacrifices? and how good might the best possible future be, if the most effective sacrifice could be made?(195)</li>
<li>Sacrifice doesn’t necessarily guarantee reward, and no one knows why (196)</li>
<li>Only under stabilized civilization, a stable social contract can be expected (196)</li>
<li>People learned to share with others, to receive from them in the future (197-198)</li>
<li>Another question surfaces: what is the greatest possible sacrifice? (199)</li>
<li>Why did God have to demand Issac’s life from Abraham despite the happy ending? (200)</li>
<li>Let’s begin thinking with this: sometimes things do not go well, and that maybe because of what we value the most (200)</li>
<li>How to catch a monkey: a monkey won’t take its hand out of a tiny jar without letting what he grabbed go. (200)</li>

<li>Satan must be the one who confronts and offers tempts Christ because he is the very archetype of Evil and Christ is that of Good. (213)</li>
<li>Christ is not tempted by Satan to transform desert rocks into bread. This means that there is more important thing than food (perhaps means expediency) even under extreme difficulties: to dine on the Word of God (the pursuit of higher meaning as the mode of living) (213-214)</li>
<li>Christ overcomes the next two temptations. Second temptation: Satan tempts Christ by telling him to throw himself off a cliff, and let God save him. Christ rejects because he knows salvation does not depend on God showing his superiority asked by His Son (215)</li>
<li>Third temptation: Satan asks Christ to take the kingdoms of the world, which is basically everything - power, control, submission, vengeance, … and this is a great immediate expediency.

<li>Then people started to wonder if the material world held solutions not yet known instead, which contributed to rapid development of science (218)</li>
<li>However Christianity accompanied some great achievements. Slavery was an admirable nobility before Christianity. Then it brought all people regardless of their social positions (slave, master, nobleman, commoner) on the same ground, level and rights. (218-220)</li>
<li>Christianity had problems. They only arose after solving entirely different set of problems. But it’s clear that post-Christianity world was less barbaric than before. (220)</li>

<li>JP listens a lot to his clients in his clinical practice. His clients have otherwise no one else to talk to. They say so many unexpected things but it’s not boring to listen. (278-280)</li>
<li>JP had one client who thinks she was raped multiple times when she was drunken, making her memory about that unsure. JP could have inclined to either side: to tell her 1) that she is an innocent victim, or 2) that she’s a walking disaster.

<li>Carl Rogers (psychotherapist), knowing the power of listening, suggested this way of discussion: each person can speak up for himself <strong>only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately.</strong> (292)</li>

<p>Several advantages to this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>You genuinely understand what the person is saying (292)</li>
<li>It aids the person in consolidation and utility of memory (293)</li>
<li>It poses difficulty to the careless construction of straw-man arguments (293)</li>

<p>Derrida argues hierarchical structures emerged to include the beneficiaries and to exclude the rest, which is built right in to the language, which is quite radical (367)</p>
<ul>
<li>example: “women” because men gain by excluding women</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derrida’s philosophy denies the idea that hierarchical structure can be made by something other than power (i.e. biological distinction between men and women, which is science, not power). Hierarchical position and reputation can’t be the consequence of skill and competence (people just dominate the field that they are good at) (368)</li>
<li>The fact that power plays a role in human motivation does not mean that it plays the only role, or even the primary role (368)</li>
<li>
<p>Not all interpretations (problems) are equally valid, but there are only a few viable solutions to problems (369)</p>
<ul>
<li>example 1: inequal distribution of valuable goods being a threat to the stability of society doesn’t mean that forced redistribution is the solution (369-370)</li>
<li>example 2: incremental remake of university administrations into private corps is a mistake? (= the government can interfere) (370)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>There is not a shred of hard evidence to support … that Western society is pathologically patriarchal; that the prime lesson of history is that men, rather than nature, were the primary source of the oppression of women (rather than, as in most cases, their partners and supporters); that all hierarchies are based on power and aimed at exclusion. Hierarchies exist for many reasons - some arguably valid, some not - and are incredibly ancient, evolutionarily speaking. Do male crustaceans oppress female crustaceans? Should their hierachies be upended?</strong> (370)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In a well-functioning, practical society, the prime determiner of status is nothing but competence, which is well-backed by empirical and academic evidences in social sciences. (371)</li>
<li>A state arguing for the hierarchy based on power is not only supporting one-sided radicalism, but also indoctrination (about ideologically-predicated theories about the nature of men and women) (371)</li>
<li>Social constructionism: society must be altered, or bias eliminated, until all outcomes are equitable. This means gender differences must be regarded as socially constructed, which is not in line with the argument for transgender surgery (372)</li>
<li>
<p>All outcomes obviously cannot be equalized (373)</p>
<ul>
<li>Women should make as much as men; black women should make as much as white women; then should salary be adjusted for all parameters of race, or even any dimension, like IQ, attractiveness, body weight, …? (373-374)</li>
<li>Group identity isn’t a thing. It can be fractionated right down to the level of the individual: every person is so much unique (374)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>None of this complexity is never discussed by postmodernists and Marxists. (374)</li>
<li>
<p>While it is empirically possible to minize the innate differences between boys and girls with pressure, that would not be freeing people of either gender to make their own choices (375)</p>
<ul>
<li>Why not then force equity-minded males to be trained more on nursing, and the females on engineering? (375)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we <em>quickly become slaves to our passions - and there’s nothing freeing about that.</em> (viii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the exact same thing the book <em>Atomic Habits</em> suggests. If you make a habit (or in the context of this book, a <em>rule</em> in your life), it is rather going to free you. For example, if you make a habit to save money, it will going to give you more freedom in buying stuffs later when you need them, while on the surface it might seem like that habit is restricting you from buying anything.</p>
<p>Isn’t it so ironic? Mere freedom doesn’t grant you freedom. It curbs you instead.</p>
<p>The connection lies in <em>Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)</em>. Almost all expediency comes at a cost and is not necessary. You can free yourself from any rules at all, but after all, that is not meaningful and is going to limit the boundaries of what you can do, since this world is not the paradise.</p>

<p>In Chapter 2, JP says happy and good don’t have a single common thing together. Never thought that way, but sounds so true when I read it.</p>
<p>I pursue a bunch of things daily that makes me happy. I would not recommend that my dog or my child (if I had one) do the same. But why am I doing that myself!? This is the moment I realized that I just need to stop all of this. I shouldn’t be pursuing things that make me only happy.</p>
<p><em>Good things</em> tend to last long. <em>Happy things</em> don’t. I think that’s one big difference. Watching a fun short clip on Youtube, for example, surely makes you happy, but it does not deserve to be said ‘good’ for you (or ‘bad’, it’s just rather nothing but something that makes you happy)</p>

<p>Everyone, if not consciously, at least should have an underlying sense of order and chaos in the corner of their minds. We know when things go ‘unlike the plan’. We know when things go ”as planned’.</p>
<p>As JP mentioned, such a phenomenon is unavoidable and already everywhere.</p>
<p>So what becomes important is what I do then. How much am I confident in surviving the world of order and chaos? How much am I ready and prepared in my mind to challenge myself with this?</p>
<p>Perhaps I will first need to start the day with the daily plans. Not needlessly long, but just concise enough to specify what it is that I need to do for the day.</p>

<p>This is absurdly <em>hard</em>. Even with the innately selfish human nature. Even after reading the chapter 2, I still keep asking myself: what the heck is going on? Why can’t I care myself enough? Why did I miss breakfast so many times knowing that it wouldn’t be good for my health? Why did I sleep late and wake up late knowingly?</p>
<p>After reading <em><a href="https://joel.is-a.dev/2020-10-04-100BooksProject-(9):Atomic-habits/">Atomic Habits</a></em>, I decided to get rid of the bad habits, but it wasn’t still easy. But after reading about the second rule, I now have enough motivation to try again.</p>
<p>There is almost not a single day, or just a single day so far in 2022 that I have missed having breakfast. I’m also making a record of the time I go to sleep and wake up since the beginning of 2022. <em>Persistence is the key.</em> Despite the absence of record for the late 2021, I know it must have been so dreadful. Here’s the record so far for 2022:</p>

<p>Not so bad, but not satisfying, I would say. My target bedtime is 11AM and wake-up time 7AM or earlier. But overall, it’s much more positive than the last year’s me. I got this and I can do this.</p>

<p>I personally think being a responsible adult is one of the palpable themes in the book. Specifically, Rule 5 entails the reason to be one. Although the title reads <em>Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them</em>, JP’s point is right on the fact that all children will become adults some day. Therefore, if children are not disciplined and not trained to be social and responsible to live along with others, they are not going to be a good adult when they grow up. That’s JP’s insistence with which I agree.</p>
<p>If you search ‘grow the hell up’ on Google, one of the first things you will probably see is Jordan Peterson’s lecture, or his tweet, or something from him anyway.</p>
<p>I like this wording very much: grow the hell up. Yes, everyone needs to grow the hell up.</p>
<p>Just thinking about how I behave throughout the day, if someone were monitoring me 24/7 and I didn’t know that (like God), then I would feel 200% embarrassed for what I have been doing.</p>
<p>Too many parts of my life are still so childish. Can’t control myself. No disciplines, no rules. Sometimes just doing what I want for fun, for expediency. For immediate happiness.</p>
<p>So that line really touched me because I really need to grow the hell up. Otherwise, what’s so different between myself and a child apart from the uselessly gigantic magnitude of my body.</p>
<p>An adult is an adult. An adult who doesn’t want to take responsibilties - <em>not</em> wanting to do the dishes, do exercises, pay the bill, take a shower, brush teeth, empty the trash can, do laundry, make a living, give presents to friends, visit parents once in a while - is just a child. It’s just doing what others always do. Easy.</p>
<p>In the times of Covid, especially when I am just stuck at home, no one’s watching me other than myself, so I am quite programmed to sit in front of my laptop and do useless stuffs like surfing on the web, which is obviously not quite the definition of a grown-up adult. This isn’t what I should do and I’ve got a clear aim for the year (undisclosed).</p>

<p>Being stooped doesn’t help. This is what JP mentioned in the first chapter: <em>Stand up straight with your shoulders back</em>.</p>
<p>I still remember my stooped, or crooked posture during my high school years. Now that I think back, there were reasons for it:</p>
<ol>
<li>My backpack was way too heavy, which my made my shoulders rounded, and overall posture stooped. Due to the stupid fear that I would leave something behind in my school locker when I would need it home, I just decided to carry everything in my bag. And that was the time iPad didn’t exist yet, and still lots of academic materials were in an actual materialistic form. Anyway, due to some naive decision I decided to carry everything in my bag, and so I even got myself a very hard and strong bag: a <a href="https://www.swissgear.com/">Swissgear</a> one. That allowed me to carry even heavier things with me, which then contributed to stooping my neck and shoulders even more.</li>
<li>The high school was a time of difficulties. I could barely sleep and almost always could not have breakfast due to overwhelming amount of assignments and homework. I think I wanted to be compensated somehow by being recognized of my difficulty, and represented that desire by having that stupid posture, implying something like: “hey man, I’m out of my energy. Guess what made me like this”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, stupid reasons. But I fixed that right after graduating, or in the middle of my high school years - I don’t quite remember clearly. But now I’m standing up straight with my shoulders back. The only problem is that my occupation is somewhat prone to rounded shoulders (haha).</p>
<p>This also leads to the topic of confidence (sometimes blatancy, too). Why not get confident instead of denouncing or disbeliving yourself. Even if you fail later, there’s a bad reason not to get confident about yourself.</p>
<p>Everyone enters the world of chaos every moment. That often leads the way down to being unconfident. You’re doing some project at work and someone quits his job and you’re lost. You’ve filed an application for higher education and unsure about the upcoming result. You’ve launched a business and unconfident if things will work out. All of these things. But when you think about it, there’s really no reason to be unconfident. Of course, being critical and being unconfident are differnt and you already know why. Being critical is OK and will help. But unconfident? why? Even confidence with no reason may be better than unconfidence sometimes.</p>

<p>I feel grateful for having my present friends. They’re all motivated, successful individuals. They know how to enjoy, challenge, endeavor, and sometimes chill. We sometimes help each other, talk through some problem, or hang out together. They are certainly not of the type that I wouldn’t want my family members or another friend to be friends with, which is coherent with <em>Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you</em>.</p>

<p>From some of the casual chats with my friends, I noticed that some of them are comparatively more subject to comparing themselves with others. And this is an evident problem for me too, but under my unconsciousness, I kind of try to become oblivious to this because of the fear that merely noticing it might hurt my self-esteem.</p>
<p>There are millions of developers who are more skillful and able than me. I’m also now ‘stuck’ between employment and education because I now need to go back to school and finish my degree, which will take at least 1.5 years for which I am not sure if I will be able to work. My friends and other successful individuals I get to look at on Linkedin are all off schools and at work, seemingly commencing a good career path. That actually makes me not want to go onto Linkedin too often. Many job offers are knocking on the door weekly but I can’t simply accept them for now, unless they are part time or full time promised for some distant future. I feel like I’m <em>late</em> compared to others. But <em>Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.</em> To iterate the core of JP’s argument just once more: there is no point comparing others with you. What’s even being <em>late</em>? There’s no <em>late</em>. Already, <em>late</em> can be justified when there’s someone else to be compared with.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided not to slip into the swamp of dismal comparisons anymore. My goal is mine, and my life is mine. Can’t be compared with others’.</p></div><hr style="margin-bottom:1.75rem"/><div style="display:flex"><div class=" gatsby-image-wrapper" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;width:50px;height:50px;margin-right:0.875rem;margin-bottom:0;min-width:50px;border-radius:100%"><img aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,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" alt="Joel Mun" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition-delay:500ms;border-radius:50%"/><noscript><picture><source srcset="/static/1265356b9e6bab3ff8ccafeaca6d96b8/99438/profile-pic.jpg 1x,
